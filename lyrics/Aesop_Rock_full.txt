I saw the wrought-iron cross inverted circlin' above my turret
Slid the spiraling banister down and hide, banished am I
My ruby glass glazed specs staple the trader of market thieves
Where vendors count the stolen citrus out their pyramids
Mirrored without a slapstick
Mavericks plugged directly to third rail surges
Piss on electric mayhem through city commuter circuits
Oooh child, raised as oddity, son of a circus side-show freak
Pertinent to the slide show, the wino's leak but I won't speak
Infected projection hung thick in the air
Pungent as burning plastics upon whiffing the nasal cringes
Pucker another 60-second lapse while 60 stars collapse the suckers
And I'm reborn every time the wine metamorphs back to water, my god
Sweet Christ, crucify me with railroad spikes
Use my skull to bash them all in, gather sit and grin, weave
All fail the most serene communication pageant
Where sitting with a stranger and living awards the badges
I spell merit with my name stitched on my heritage
And serenade arrogant simpletons to feed my cherished grin
Buried in leagues a "'Please', Thank You', 'Pardon', 'Excuse Me'
'Your Welcome', 'May I?' ohh, I'd like to nod but no you may not
Let's take a deep breath, naw let's take a breath
Naw let's take, naw let's aaah shit, well I guess that about says it
Maybe I'll craft the sycamore canoe and paddle upstream
Where the luck seems to reflect precious lovely interventions

I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for you and yours
For kicking your fantasies overboard
I mean I'm only one servant, making one hell of a diversion
And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed
I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for them and theirs
For breaking down their ropes, ladders and stairs
I mean I'm only one servant, making one hell of a diversion
And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed

You ever died a thousand deaths?, I have
And in the morrow stood a thousand steps from where my nourish laughed
And made a boat at, nomad, I roam in a social coma
Jonesing for home alone days to sit and count my poems, I
Dig in the dirt I rig up the earth like pulley systems
Thereby painting the perfect metaphor for hung juries
Strung along a song of spawning thorns of fury
Numb the anti-add-alarm before he recognized this worries me
Carpet-bombers spearheading fink operetta
Walk my line, now what? Now strut that little poison combine
Y'all call natural, in honesty promise me twenty thousand Sloppy leagues
And dive and finding my thriving ivy leaves climbing up the pit fall
Lack of most lords aboard, heroes unsung heroes unbrung rewards
Yo if I flutter in a trouble clutch then I dance fancy forward
Like park children double dutching ropes in burning city summers
My wing span can and will employ full expansion
Unfolding while lamping at home with my hands panning for gold
Told them the roof was on fire, when that structure burned to ashes
All y'all saw was Aesop Rock holding an empty book of matches
Maybe I'll sit until the spilling motors clear
Maybe I'll sit and stroke my billie goat beard
And rethink the time angels appear, maybe I won't
Bundled in my humble little plummet
Numb enough to die those thousand deaths under the sun it makes me sickFasten your seatbelts, remove glasses
Bright lights, bright lights
I wear shoes to bed
Paint teeth on my lips
Trench foot, gangrened for the win
Blitzkrieg Bopper
Petitioned out of shit's creek proper
The only inaccessible blip on the streaming doppler
Screaming 'uncle' in a sea of TV doctors
Free to occupy the same space in differing degrees of seedy commerce
The shot is slow pan, monitor guffawing
Flooded p.d. blotter under horizontal coffee
More to follow, outside tweakers are in love
Teeny Raquel Welch submarining through the blood, voyagers
Poisoned or maybe just a misfit toy or two
Depending on the beacon that your voyeurs choose
That sorta hemming and hawing'll haunt your boiler rooms abysmally
And kidnap rapid eyes in their infancy
Everything his cutting room scrapped
On a silver screen that throws gummy bears back (attack!)
All these tribes hoard breads and wines
These climates transform men to swine
(AGAIN!)
All these hives hide knives and lead
These bribes can't transform swine to men
Alright
Sensible sweater on ice
Devil horns high
Like shovels above a butter lamb with peppercorn eyes
Vendetta-drunk leader squealing
"it's the real pig fever"
Sick people pinky swearing on concealed 6th fingers
That's idle handwork in the spirit of death dealers
Look at mommy's little Hercules
Custom Troy Hurtubise
Flourish in the blind spot of Spittle County 'Gore Police'
Or really any readily ebbing and flowing 'War and Peace'
1 plain brown Key Foods bag head
2 holes later I'll see to this loose flatbread
Cats fucked off, at exactly what cost
The currency of brotherhood back in his cut palm
It sucks, it's nauseating dawn crawling with bugs
They seem attracted to the matters of the morally snubbed
See my 'Goodnight Irene' massacred flat in the key of tragedy
Whole diner like "I'll have what he's having"
We rolling now, official?
Uhuh, uhuh
Turn the beat up a little
Uhuh, uhuh
Outside the box, Lif you with me?
Yeeah I'm with ya
Aright, let's go

Some cats grow by the laws of the wild
Some learn slower and lag in the mud
Some stand up in defense of a style
Some let the big dogs eat them up
At exactly 11:35pm on January 21st I fell asleep sound
At exactly 11:35pm on Januray 21st some shit went down

Now Benny was a New York City graff kingpin
Five borough fame, guaranteed to itch pigskin
Raided near the Brooklyn Naval yard, juxed undercover
When they asked him what he pled he said, "You're fuckin' up my colors!"

Okay, Jose is working in the slaughterhouse
And he's living in the hood, but he wants to get his daughter out
Slipped off a ledge, and fell into a machine
Another dead immigrant, that's the American Dream

Miss Molly, helpless, made a penny with a data entry temp gig
Overqualified but the rent's thick
Red brick bash with a texted green screen
Like, "I entered my data right into your screen"

Jane went insane, she's an anchorwoman
Sick of pushing skewed information
And abusing the nation
Had a few options:
Either jump or run (RUN!)
Quit or cold raise hell waving a gun (GUN!)
Time for C-H-A-N-G-E
Held a knife to the VP on TV
She demanded that the format be expanded
Beyond fair, everybody clear, understand it?Some cats grow by the laws of the wild

Billy was a coke fiend

Maggie was a cop

Like a dope he stole green

She patroled the block

Banking off his old scheme

She recognized his plot

He thought he was home free

She knew that he was locked

Now it's off to the jail in a blue squad car

She pocketed the crack before they got far

Billy watches Maggy from behind steel bars
Like "Where the crack went"

"I'ma smoke it tomorrah"
Bad back, bad back, bad back
One half zig while the other half zag
Stand too long and the whole shit hunch
Sit too long and I can't stand up
Gramps out for a Sunday drive
A man as betrayed by his lumbar spine
Who pull up to the spot like, "I'll meet y'all inside
I need like five"
Corpse pose, staring at the moon
Entirely on fire, Sciatica to boot
I'm ready to be turned into soup
Or shot into space, or squashed into cubes
"Rate your pain level on a scale from one to ten"
I said, "Well doc, I tell you, I feel like I lost a friend"
I'm usually okay to simply shut up and cope
But these days more than ever, my back is like, "Nope"Hunters with their dogs and deer rifles
Thousands of them line the pavement
Like patient pupae waiting to become worms

The people are dead, but the money keeps talking keep-keeps-keep-keeps talking
The people are dead, but the money keeps talking, keep
Keeps-keep-keeps talking
(Another dark night)
Teething I'm marking a beast sheep
Like I walk in front of 39 thieves in a "v"
Smores over warm helvetica brown proper
For the odd God or monster, propped to teleprompter
Wild blue yonder, blue in the face, angel
Blew into the bugles in lieu of the euthanasia
Usually the shooter community chew the corpse
But I see the wolves have already gotten to you and yours
Day of the dead, play the ledge closely
Train a barrel of monkeys to aim at the lowest bogey
Dope the gonzo I've always felt choked socially
Stole the golden fleece with the culture of total nobodies
Earth rised, divided by fighting tribes
All we do is watch 'em waddle back and forth lighting fires
Detonator, wire cutter, pliers
Two cities enter, one is broken up in tiny tiles
And I won't pose arm in the heart of the lion's throat
For a photographic token of my primordial growth
You parade around and kill, so damn proud
Like a flatline fetish, had it's feathers fanned out
War taught him symmetry, skipped into it gingerly
Silk worms ping-pong ministry to ministry
Hell's bells every which way the the wind blows
So I bang my head against any wall you can build, go

Another dark night, another not alright
Another bad ritual, more botched surgery
Better follow the bread crumbs back in fact, urgently
Or waddle through this section where the natives feel "murdery"
Vicinity wander, claim no soul
Never let an anchor drop
Never had a home, never talk to strangers
Never trust a friend
This is the life and the life will not end
Next time think
39 thieves are quicker than 40 winks...
Raise your drinks
39 thieves are quicker than 40 winks
We're not concerned with the community aloofness
Dude, we're animals, we just go where the most food is
Lower the toast, most formal etiquette is useless
Truth is you're equally expendable
if spoon-fed
Money is cool, I'm only human
But they use it as a tool to make the workers feel excluded
Like the shinier the jewel the more exclusive the troop is
Bullets don't take bribes stupid, they shoot shit
And it is with the dogs with their rifles, thousands of them line the pavement, like patients pupae waiting to become worms
(I feel good as new, good as new, good as new, good as new....)
The people are dead, but the money keeps talking

Another dark night, teethin the market of B-sheep, like I'm walking around the 39 thieves in a beat spores of a warm Helvetica brown proper for the odd gutter monster propped on the teleprompter, wild blue yonder blue in the face angel blew into the bugle in lieu of the euthanasia, usually the shooter community chew the corpse but I see the wolves have already gotten to you and yours, day of the dead play the ledge closely train the barrel of monkeys to aim at the lowest bogey, dope, the gonzo have always felt choked socially, stole the golden fleece with the culture of total nobodies earth lies divided by fighting tribes all we do is watch em waddle back and forth lighting fires (money money) detonator wire cutters pliers two cities and one is broken up in tiny tiles and I walk, pose, harmin the heart of the lion's throat for a photographic children of my primordial growth, you parade around a kill so damn proud like a flat-line fetish had his feathers fanned out, war totem symmetry, skip into it gingerly, silk worms ping pong minister to ministry, hells bells every which way the winds blows, so I bang my head against any wall you can build, go

Another dark night, down it goes, tread around the rabbit hole, weapons to the heavens and arsenic where the carrots grow, piss warm suger water where the summer canteen plus burn rubber like green is the new green, rubber neck froze, slows by the multiplex, rodeo commotion I'm open to see what culminates, bourgie on the right, left rep rebel force, both say the futile "prove the parking lot was never yours," black top pebble bores, soldiers molded when the joneses every grown-up in Dakota came to groping, no motives they showed em the gross quotas, hog barn burner come see if your home told us, 85 rattle trap park the fancy, he could swear he was steppin outta Comanche, antsy, let us in he jettison the medicine and paranormal hatchery condense and break the levees in (money money), we both know the totem camaraderie, tokin' up equality, they posted horizontally, pride of golden load the doctor brought a lobster colony, half-mass slags have caps through em properly, and sleep the sleep of the just, ready on the left when the witchcraft spun it with a neighboring sect, with the usual undesirables and the Big Brother cutters, on the day your name became "This motherfucker?!"

This is the life, this is the life, this is the life
The people are dead but the money keeps talkingI was sitting on my fire escape and I saw
Sturdy bridges, decorated with dirty pigeons

A vagabond begging for three pennies and a princess
A junkie tourniquet surgeon urging the needle in
A batty senior citizen flashing that awful teethless grin
I saw a corner store merchant rest on a milk crate with a stog'
A pierced nose, a model with a stalker, cheap hooker, jay walkers
A table on a sidewalk with four old men slappin' dominos down
A city, a village, a neighborhood, a ghost town
I saw vandals catching tags
and Puerto Rican flags
I saw a pregnant woman on the verge of bursting
I saw a blind man with a dog screaming someday I'll see it all
And then he sat down with his hammer and saw
Business men with multi-colored ties, cashing their checks
A Nazi with tattoos on his neck, a Vietnam War vet
A Caucasian man with a limp and a cane, a pimp with his dames
A thug circus, a pack of shook tourists hugging their purses
I saw freaks with rainbow streaks in dayglo hair
A mother smackin' the grin off her child, replaced it with a stare
A pothole, a storefront with a broken open sign
A hole in the wall bar kicking drunks to the gutter, it's closing time
I see a fuck up, a bum knuckle up with a taxi driver
A squatter, a grandfather, an
angry right-to-lifer
I can see the roof garden on the apartment across the street
And kick myself because somewhere along the way I lost my seeds
I see a rat, a roach, a bat approach, a happy student
A black man with a horn and a will to make you sit and listen to it
I see a little girl on the corner with bubbles, braids and barrettes
I see a teen mother with Similac, pacifier, and regrets
Oh, a day turned stale, a
hammer with a rusty nail, a failed marriage
A universe of brick buildings slightly off balance
A challenge,
I see a chance to add real colors to my favorite palette
Raise my mighty mallet towards the gods and swing my talents
I see a crack in the sidewalk
A slide show of sick civilians gripping bottles like idiots
Sitting inside bent meridians
There's a fun house ooh, a
sun spout
Spraying yellow beams
above yellow back dreams
And children in the hydrants
Hybrids, I see sirens
The wall to the glamor standard
A dead bird, a red curb
A bus stop where commuters wait to have their souls towed off to work
I see the slapdash habits of bike messengers pausing
To huff that good leaf on the way to damage packages for peddlers
Oh my lord, I see bandwagons, all aboard
A carnival amusement park where a heart is a luxury
I see a gas galaxy huddled behind those pearly doors
Maybe I should sit up on my fire escape a little more
What's up? This is Aesop Rock for WKCR, check it

I traded my title as bent pedestrian for passenger status to coast muted
Finding the night train mildly therapeutic
Rugged hacker flashing mood full of swings
Beneath this puppet master pulling my strings
,
leaking smoke rings
Singing 
Syndicate sold to children building homes for my omnipotent platoons
Nah, I don't think the blueprints drafted tilted in the tombs
Tampering hampered scampered well beyond the dooms
We bloomed  to those most beautifully discrete
Applying yesterdays models stand obsolete amongst colossals (Amongst colossals)
Comply not to enforce us aborted claiming they came off
Sort of stabbed them with the capital 'A' that sets my name off
Sick of it all, sick of the stalls, sick of the thick brick in the wall
Sob stories, the falls, the tragic hate calls
Shaking like magic eight balls pausing to watch the vapors crawl
My clique heeds lessons I'll be noted from kids sisters paper dolls
We lining up along these great walls, circling analytical (Analytical)
Rhetorical inquiries, yet x is not applicable, kid

You're talkin' concrete examples with glass bottoms cause defeated, kid, I'm heated
It's flight of the intruder and we all fall down
Conditions of never blends science with religion (Uh)
Cut my character cleansed in esoteric opulence
But finding no intrinsic merit in your sense
Well, isn't that bewildering? Drunken distortion and spit the filter in (Yeah)
Mic sweltering measures like melting my rings together and you never
Seen I, Aesop Rock, flop for the love of eighty-nine point nine
I'm here to ride upon the night train

Yeah, WKCR, eighty-nine point nine, it's night train
What's up to my man Apex, Kinetic, DJ Ely, Baz,
my man Dub-L, my production
, the mighty Ger, my Man Patrick,
Blockhead
, Mr. Roper,
Omega One
, my man hates one, Percee P, Andre
Stay up, it's like that. And it's big Aesop Rock signing off
Zoom in to the fuming of an aggravated breed
Via the study of post-adolescent agitated seeds
Half the patients wasted self prior to Commencement
So I focus on the urban Oxygen samples, the half that made it breathe
They sold Pompeii impression, waste infections
And twelve steps to lesson
Cretins swiftly tippy toe on hard to swallow, barter concepts
The give-it get-it, never let it self passport our stubbornness
Martyrs talks money causes in a harvesting Spartacus
And so on
I've thrown long Hail Mary bombs
Toward cookie-cutter Mother Natures bedazzled synthetic fabrics
Life treats the peasants like
They tried to fuck his woman while he slept inside
Well they're merely chasing perfectionist emblems
When the clock strikes nine
I'll be waking with the best of routine caffeine team players
For the cycle of it
Under a dusted angel harp string Big Brother is watching
My odometer like buzzard to fallen elk,
talking stealth
We got babies, rubber stamps, and briefcase parts
We on some door-to-door now
Order ten dollars or more, we'll shove it down your throat for free
I'll sacrifice my inborn tendencies
For copper pennies for one commanding "Gimme that"
So we can retain baby fat
Make the biter snake bedlam
Holocaust freak, heckle shiesty brain headroom shaped planet
Make a move, pause, make a move break cannon
Bent barrel one eight zero, U-Turn, squeeze, end it
It's on like it's never been
It's bleeding well
It's bigger than a breadbox
It corrodes my leaky finance
I'll take my seat atop the Brooklyn Bridge
With a Coke and a bag of chips
To watch a thousand lemmings plummet just because
The first one slipped
Sometimes I laugh at victory, kissing these little question marks
I tend to underestimate my average
Just another bastard savage
Someday you'll all eat out of my cold hand
Cuz every dog has its day
At which point, I'll pull it away

Now we the American working population
Hate the fact that eight hours a day
Is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us
And we may not hate our jobs
But we hate jobs in general
That don't have to do with fighting our own causes
We the American working population
Hate the nine-to-five day-in day-out
When we'd rather be supporting ourselves
By being paid to perfect the pastimes
That we have harbored based solely on the fact
That it makes us smile if it sounds dope

It's the year of the silkworm
Everything I built burned yesterday
Let's display the purpose that these stilts serve
Elevate the spreading of the silk germ
Trying to weave a web but all that I believe in is dead
Nah brother, it's the year of the jackal
Saddle up on high horse
My torch forced Polaris embarrassed
Shackle up the hassle by the dooming legend marriage
I bought some new sneakers
I just hope my legacy matches
It's the year of the landshark
Dry as sand, parched, damn get these men some water
They're out there being slaughtered
In meaningless wars so you don't have to bother
And can sit and soak the idiotbox trying to fuck their daughters
Man it's the year of the Orphan
Seated adjacent to the firefly circling the torches on your porches
Trying to guard the fortress of a king they've never seen or met
But all are trained to murder at the first sign of a threat
Maybe it's the year of the waterbug
Cockroach utter thug specimen
Fury spawned from dreaming of your next of kin
I'm still dealing with this mess I'm in
I've been the object of your ridicule
You've been a bitch lieutenant
God, it's the year of the underpaid employee
Spittin' forty plus a week
And tryin' to rape Earth on my off time
You bored dizzy, I can't keep myself busy enough
So you can run run run
And I'mma let you think you won
EVERYBODY!

We the American working population

Fumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition and
Yawn and stretch and my life is a mess and
If I never make it home today, God bless
Fumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition and
Yawn and stretch
and my life is a mess and
If I never make it home today, God bless

Is a love such as that which I exhibit for my practice
The factor which then amalgamates debates with straight-jackets and robes
Huddled in brackets that blacken the average globe
Xenophobe, loathe to modify the fly, feel this
I carve a notch in my wall for every stall
Every fifth mark slants diagonal to symbolize your downfall
Drunky peasants, honor the shifty Megatron presence
Slug a bolt once ceremonies of merit turn bloodsport
(Uh)
Voted hella high seas, I freeze your mega dumb company
Pumping out wise beads like, plot sneak-attacks on dry leaves, dunce
Crooked rumors turn zoomers when rookies talkin'
Bad seeds blossom the Wookiee walk; hawk and
Let a sucker drift, I lift up every stone prone to find
The point at which repellent signals ultimately bind
When a pack of style mimics see my brains target the cluster
I advance clutchin' the mic like bully to knuckle duster
And ascend; your riddles yield a little plastic blend
Fuck a badge, light a bonfire dancin' jig around the pig
Figurin' yeah, I'll land a plane on bleached-stained trackers
Usin' only the finest and post-modern terrain mappers
Once my brethren disperse
My god, you think the heavens touched the earth then
Thirstin' a perch on a bursted curse
, but I don't; confide: wine and water chose me
Bored: lasso down Polaris, let the glow amuse me
I was staring off into the water
Looking for some undiscovered colors
Like a blue that really wasn't, but it wasn't any others
The synesthetic cousin to the hum of his discomfort
I been a punching bag for some truly deluded garbage
Now his handshake is a unicorn, his hug a moving target
Dark days either sparing change for the square pegs
Or in his fav chair sipping on bear mace
Tripping through his daymare, marathoning monster flicks
Zombie in the stale air, logging his Hayashi pics
I been trying to teach your kid to ollie
She got the basic motion and glow when she show her mommy
I get they want the hows and whens of water cooler powder kegs
That shit that get your saintly favorites ousted from the power grid
I know I know some shit about some shit
I guess that gotcha gossip simply isn't part of how I live

Skin cold to the touch
Eyes open, no pulse
Diagnosis in flux

Traffic in a mad world
Mad world, whereupon
Often times the body spits the spirit out and carries on
To engineer some semblance of a normal life, yours and mine
Then of course it's normalcy where paranormal's normalized
Normal is a phantom force that levitates the forks and knives
Or otherworldly parasites that quarrel over portion size
Hit the floor and you could be the next unfriendly energy to organize
Ordering corpses into the chorus line
Best friends and death beds
Red cents, and headwinds vs one man who's ten men
I bubble to the surface legendarily imperfect
Purging Slurpee from a head that turns incessantly in circles, it's concerning
My psychic likes to focus on a orb
And tell me how she sees me coming home to goldfish on the floor, in perpetuity
I been sleeping in my armchair, taking weird walks, and speaking to folk who aren't there

Skin cold to the touch
Eyes open, no pulse

The engineer, obsession right here
Uh huh
Like this

I spit with an immense amount of power
Sparks flame showers, cowards, cower, underneath our
Storm clouds that indicate the acid rain hours
Now or, never, ever, ending on a bad note
Ripping a crab's throat, for spitting a bad quote
(Blueprint what's your approach?)
I smash black folk and white folk alike for jokes with mics
And make a Kodak moment out of the most boring open mic
I'll make a sad fan appreciate rap again
Fuck around and forget just how whack it's been
I'm a bad man (Why's that?)
I catch bullets in my molars, body slam boas
And take flight with the weight of the world on my shoulders
And play David Blaine on any chains that hold us
What started out as food for thought
Turned into thoughts to turnin' crews into food in hopes to satisfy my
Insatiable appetite to dine on lifeforms, small planets and satellites
Your solar system is my condiment
;
I
vomit comets
, and don't sweat the small things and nonsense
Every dog has his day and even more so in rhyming
So I decided that I'd never play the fire hydrant
Or grab the mic sounding lazy, worn down and tired;
Cats don't really fall off they just get uninspired
But before you, get a reason to ever diss us
I'll drop an ill LP and disappear like
Bobby Fischer

Sports and leisure

Important people take a mold of my footprint
It doesn't match a single fauna track in your bookends
I fashion me a hoodie from the head of a bushpig
Push the red button
, I am back on my bullshit
Whether back row, throwing Sno-Caps at the pulpit
Or backyard bat into the black of the solstice
Pulls rabbits out a hat and turns brats into sculptures
Magi, mags to the roadwork
Ghost world P.M., he a surgeon with the echo
Blindfolded, float around the Petco, perfecto
I'm sending out an S.O.S. and training for the longest night
Or any situation where invaders may have clawed his eyes
Out
, T-rex tooth necklace
Smells like Biofreeze and all-day breakfast
Bass Pro base layer, pacemaker, cell phone, med kit
See you assholes in the tempest
Raised on 1010 WINS, on the ones every ten mins
Big League Chew and stupid pet tricks
Now I'm green vines up red brick
Climb 'til he pluck a supergiant out of Pegasus
Blow the house down easy peasy
It's the deacon of disaster pulling reefer out his beanie
Handwriting born of regional graffiti
Disobedient thereafter, kid
it's veni, vidi, vici
, yeah

Handwriting born of UFO sighting
I ain't down with jackin' styles, I'm jackin' clouds for silver linings
Listen, fams, to my advantage, been abandoned law abiding
I'm the baddest, I don't panic when the planets are colliding
Fresh start for the convict
No cost, come and get dipped in the solvent
Fabric of my tailor-made garment
Torn sail, third rail, tail of a comet
Me and my counterpart
Come to put it down over the counter at your local mart
Take your pound of flesh, but keep from anything around the heart
'Fore I go kaput, I stomp a foot and split the ground apart
There is only one degree of certainty
You won't find me training using anything with circuitry
Far as Earth and outer space, I done a courtesy
And cased the whole place just in case of emergency
Don't ask me why I'm actin' rougher, yo
I am not the one that killed the buffalo
Based on only optics, I could pop in and approximate a tub to soak
Based on only oxygen, I'm known to blow a cloud of smoke
I just rode in town a couple hours ago
Not too many and already, I done found the glow
Swam the fountain, vlimbed the holy mountain, spent the pot of gold
And would have kept it low-key, but the homie asked me, "How'd it go?"He's a Maniac. Maniac
All in all in all in all in all
(laughs)
All in all ...
All star navigate blood-bath circuit...circuit
All city wolf pack'll arm all servants...service
All and all cut from similar scissors and surgeons
...circus
All machines murder if the herders merked nervous
...nervous
In around em all in all out pedigree centipede maladjusted curb purge all binge
All out a machine with cog misalignment - shooting star
Eight-ball all alien appendage out his cookie jar
These are not his office hours
What he coughs is mandatory
Three obnoxious hawks and howlers
Roughly buff the categories
Twenty broad shoulders, all sober, all circuit-prowler
And matador electric tongue stung at sergeant markers sour
Who the fuck, needle Jux property
Chickens've all been
Soaked under the water works, all other birds evolve with me
Duck and a phoenix and rout behemoth architecture out the jungle
Where my condors can reorganize their numbers
All day pool party in  journalism Zion
And bazooka flash the grin she decorate the closest Nikon
Bazooka flash the molars decorate the close Minoltas
Canon Hasselblad quicker than Polaroid exposures
If open voltage leads all funny play tip the fuddy duddy fuck long come on
Get your stolen drums on
All of y'alls all dumb out pimping art like a whore's bach
And all of y'alls all couldn't rap your way out of a card-board box
Get high now, solidify your zone
And let the medallion of spiritual accomplishments keep growing
Recently, my neighbor spotted me casing my own house
I said I only really like to go in when I go out
"You okay, dude?" "Yeah, you okay?" "Yeah, I'm good"
"Yeah?" "Yeah," "Good," "Alright"
I know every black crow in the city by its first name
And its surname, and its bird call, and its birthday
Look, I'm cursed
Ran down Main like a man on fire from a church
Mangiest scalp in the state, angriest eyes in the world
Son pipes up, "Tell me, old man, how is that you could even know that?
It's not even a thing that scientists knows how to measure"
Gramps like, "Sonny, I been all over this motherfuckin' road map
I can tell you science ain't the only player in the network"
Y'all shoulda seen the boy face
Nothin' like a smug young punk realizin' what his counterpoint ain't
All the smartest people that I know seem to teeter in a paranoid state
You can know it all and never know you haven't actually departed point A
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you sayin' there's a B?
No, I'm saying you won't ever need to limit the edition when you're free, woah
So, what do you do when you get to Z?
Bro, look, there is not a chance
I am not officially a ghost
Invisible and slamming all the doors
A paranormal scrambling of phones, look
There is not a day
An ember isn't cupped in his hands
It's slowly reaching up into the sky
It's fluctuating under my command
, look
I don't use shortcuts, I don't use pace cars
Cut through a graveyard
Just to cut through another graveyard
Just to cut through another graveyard
"He's no longer on the radar"
"When I'm in a re-no-vative state of mind I'm innovative"

It's like antisocial
Hazardous portion organically nourished
Courage to flourish in music's orphans
Lunge nicotine dream missing link weariest
Caution we proclaim till brain's arch like Sagittarius Shield
Yield to the eyes as mescaline killin' fields
Rise groggy stone gaze marching moodily
'til ... plural styles amalgamated beautifully
Rudely awoke,
sing rubber-glue conglomerates
Sucking up love
While brushing parasitic critics to my left side
I test glide
Kamikaze crash distort that's on my preface (check)
The therapeutic unit recommended
Now slow-mo Quasimotos teeter on ringleader status
While I spit satellite photos while teetering on the stratus
Sleepwalking the atlas after none
.
Trudge and nudge my ninety-nine octane brain
To one-oh-one
Run to organize my mood
Like cauterize my wound and climb up
Lovely samaritans line up like bar codes
For a fraction of my factions
The hollow of his hand beholds contraptions via
Amplified files collapsed your cacophonic' conquest. My specs up
Morph hostile and docile insubordinance your phylum
Chordata
asylum swarmes' your coordinates. Rush
Must not sleep, must warn others
I'll tourniquet your turbulence
Then trample on your stutters
If I could displace every vagrant in America
With traces of my character
The Earth would be a more pitiful habitat
With infinite acres of auto-cry intricate nature
Swung open the nomenclature to obscure warlock trickery.Pure
Hazmat got tossed back by liquors supporting patience
Working knuckles for audio duplication
That's like fiending for a purpose

Aesop Rock, prototype Robocop
Jabberwocky rocking on the highest hilltop
I possess two siamese styles that's like connected at the mic hollering monstrous
Poly-tech impede
indidgy
progress, deaf
Swept off your meridian. It's operation Start With a Slummy
Raped Your Milk and Honey
Can I like, conjure up like all potent components of like
Middle siblings scribbling on his lonesome like
Hit him with my ninety-nine metal plated mics upon the wall, take em' down, pass em'round, rock em' all. Bust it
I'm forever building my City of Lost Children ripping rungs off your ladder at a
Sardonic smirk.
Ebonics lurking where the crop circles got stamped out from the rain dance
Tsunami rain blast lift off like origami cranes and sloppy braincasted class-a-piece mastered to capture your flag then flutter
While slaves defy water sucked through from paper bags
The magic-maker dragging devils to add triple sixes melt the triple glitches on your console
I calibrate my mics prior to claimin' shit is rockable
Unlock and pull a backdoor for the bounce
While cannily panicking was the average. I broadcast modern boredom mesozoic poetry pupils
Caught up in scruples from the inimical nature of my program
Elegantly overcast password curse an a tactless bastard
Catatonic until personal practice mastered

APPLESEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!
Yeah, yeah, I recall the
First time I bumped heads with my head led to a dead bargain, a
"Thanks for nothin, lowlife" and a start of, "Beg my pardon,"
When a dust mite harbored spite it barely
Dents the cicada phase
, blades averted
Decorate the backs of freedom fighters, servants pick those
Steeples higher,
man the loose cannons
"Pannin for gold?" Nah panning for chance to land in camps branded with
"Push" stamped on their hand
lets
Push, let's push up through the
Now
,
let's evoke a vow of
Zipped lips clipped to my peaking
Brow, I'm sleeping now,
I seen immaculate hearts blemished
Under the mass of genie bottle hostages who wish that a
Third to her broken promises
Black spot of Gotham, fragile
Castle and master passageway
Even the innocent captives bleed
Bleed
appleseed apple seed, leave me with a breeding
Hassle factor's feet
Pin the tail on the village idiot
Turn giddy click stern greet a burn it basics laid with the
Modes of neurotic nitpicking
Patrons and their pseudo potent
Patronage
,
ahh mood of the moment
Gloated in splendor of its
Greatness and I'm hella swamped
Truly moody in my days makeshift awakeness
Act as if apathy's been your best friend since the bonding
I'll one up you with love letters from despondency
Honestly appleseed..
Yeah!
Hi everybody, hope you're doing well
Today I want to talk to you about the different levels of the spirit world

I been floating down the River Styx
Skipper cap, sipping on what's missing from your mini-fridge
Insulated slicker dripping, winter like, "It's Britney, bitch"
Crops wither, docks splinter into popsicle sticks
Beyond the hissy fit, he ain't but a hound dog
I'm Bamm-Bamm, pianos fall on me and bounce off
Vampyrella riding pillion through the eventide
Indecency that deck the halls, an eye in each Venetian blind
I'm meat into the Venus fly, ears back and hackles up
Shifting with the shadow play, I show 'em how to rabbit hunt
It helps if you're particularly paranoid
Enough to know there's no such thing as an extraction point
Attaboy, I'm a sucker for stolen bases
Bathing in open ocean and shaving in Mobil stations
Away from the hocus pocus
The nauseating social codes and motives
The homies demoted to interlopers
Look, I can help you tumble through the galaxy
Somersaulting backwards into vacuous finality
Shabby chic, overnight a fireball from magic camp
Inspired by a banzai fly into Manhattan clam
No hands, pissing off the ferry, mission-ready
The flesh and blood are present while the rest is vision-questing
Plugged in, gloves off, shushing all tough talk
Nowhere to be found at the trust fall
I'm saying "fuck y'all", live and direct
I make a Judas shoot a flare up from the Isle of the Dead
I got a network in the netherworld I seldom reveal
It get a threat to get to stepping out my energy field
Behold the nobody who show up uninvited like his 'chute failed
Blue streak, speak in minor pentatonic blues scale
Doors blast open for the never not backlit
Never not eradicating pathogens
Rat catcher, capture both the flag and the bannermen
Batter up, throw a badass to the basilisk
Throw a fucking crab off a mountain top
Free freefalling with the shuttle parts and flowerpots
Odd hours, I'm up with the spotted owls
Spot a coward in the commons how he spot a common mouse
At a half mile,
last-minute mohawk
Eyes closed, ear to the road salt, all I hear is Mozart
Gale force winds whipping through your floppy hat
Glitch in the hologram, trick any polygraph
Chocolate from the faucet, fish in the lava lamp
Sofa on the ceiling only come down for karate class
I'm in pajama bottoms listening to Chaka Khan
Eating matcha Pocky knocking posses out the polygon
I see you proper hobnobbing with the la-di-da
That kind of shit is simply not the way I pop and lock 3x
Every little step we take breaks the dreams
Of a war pig itching to re-stitch the seams

Namsayin, when I walk, I wanna break concrete!
Ox will spit some shit that'll reflect off the mirror
My light beams are mad bright, they stay clever
Yo, challenge an Ox member, get a valve severed
Found your body in the desert (Scavenger's dessert)
Yeah yeah I rap tight like Saran
Plus enter battles talkin shit like "Look mom, no hands"
I'm tired of cats tryin to sum me
You can't add that far yet, that counting is far fetched
I treat MC like K-9s
Throwin words at they face to see if they bite when they catch
I told you my poetry sponsors Gillette
Now you standing there wit razors in your head like barrettes
Man, if the mic had ass cheeks
The sticker in my hand would say priority seating
And man, I don't know if it was me or you
But your girl was on my dick like she was teethin'
You play the role, I'll play the poppy seed on top of you
The godspeed is actual, that doesn't mean I act usual
One of the first MC's to give the crowd full attention
Cuz you need love and affection
 2x
If we could absorb every star in the sky
We noticed some shine brighter than others, you wonder why
It's the simple things in life that turn the peasants into leaders
And we know the differences between the walkers and the sleepers

I boogie with picketer vision, carbon based stickler
City piss aroma, therapy coma, clone sitter
Itching to pigeonhole villain soul magnet
Feelers activate
Passion ate the germ, and the book met the worm
I hold a book of matches captive to flash if
The sunbeams flatline
Via thick fatigue episodes, brewed in batches
The flirt of cursed perks nursed broken skeleton patches
One muddy veteran collapsed the untapped resource center
Housing style pageants
My little limbs lasso katydid wings
While mankind's babysteps break dirt and demon
I know a crossbreed strung well in the key of
Mass times weight times tamed semantics
Encompassing that which splits lips but never supplied the bandage
To hell with plastic, we edit splendid
Tap it on the shoulder, grab it, tag it, apprehend it
Lend it to the devil to befriend it, wrench it back, mend it again
It still never renders suspended 'bove finicky picket fences
Now every droid dreams to manufacture hearts
Start with cadaver parts and a blueprint
He followed the precedent set by war pigs of a yesteryear
Let the tears braid
And skip a stone over the reservoir to shake the whole charade
Gold-plated tomb or spittoon
I couldn't see
I fell asleep holding an Appleseed, woke up holding a tree
The only bridge I ever burned along this legacy I dance
Was the one that linked the cities of Prosperity and Chance
You wanna know why? Because I'm
Dead messengers buried in their
Melvins shirts
Awoken as reanimated mummies from the sepulcher
Anonymous and secular and ribbons and exposed brain
Roll with grown men who still use code names
Fold crawl space on the SS coat tails
Might chase six legs through his oatmeal
Oh dear, no pets eat his own homework
Pet cruise cobble step shoes that are bone bugs
Holmes, sick to the fishbone comb
My yellow brick shtick ain't tip toe prone
It's a misthrown sticky bomb slipping off the fingers wrong
Any blips you're witnessing are living in the Sigma laws
Blip, blip, dag, these ghosts need a doctor
Shelter, clean Dunlops on a walker
She sells sea shells, he draws revenge
Plots on a chalkboard, watch what you walk toward

Live free, die fat
Rock shot to a kill screen time lapse
Watch how the blitzkrieg climax
Spring clean hijack,
bring me my axe

Girl: What are you doing up there?
Guy: Stealing, I'm a weekend burglar
Girl: I'm on my lunch break, you want to help me kill half an hour?
Guy: No..

I'm laying in a cut overstuffed from a bad meal
Staring at the sun, on my back like a fat seal
Debating with myself about whether not rap's real
Cause broke motherfuckers are the only ones that have skill
Everybody got intentions that they can't reveal
Major label acts got to act like they don't have deals
Claiming grassroots, I'm like "hell no
Your buzz is as organic as Monsanto."
I'm going at your beanstalk, ax in hand
Over a beat by Aes Rock, that's my man
People sleeping still believing that we haven't expanded
But that's just a small part of the master plan, bitch
Printnificent, shining 'till your skin chafe
Write until the pen ache, reclining by a big lake
I'm only winning cause I went in and didn't wait
Chillin' at the crib by the time you get your shit straightRadio? Check, check
Video? Check, check
This is how the city folk and mole-people connect
Somebody warped the message prior to passin it to the next
Now the perforated counties making you upset
Harvest all Brand-X Clark Kents to worm food
Carbon heart
buried his nozzle in fossil marker art
Pardon, cadaver had a legitimate pulse
And littered volts all over the village where the skittish pigeons molt
Bastard polter gasps when the pigeon with Lazarus billy-goat whiskers
He roasted sea-salt in the open blisters
But blind anarchy slips through the cracks
See naked martyrs with Bubblelicious on fishing rods itching to pull it back
When that organic invention incubated to hatch some comply to making fructose on paper now
Apply the details later and the clues will taper out
Unruley mayor souse, who piggy jammy happy shooting at the bladed mouth
Bazooka Tooth zoo-keep the paper route with janky funds and favors
Cradled by twelve empty Zelda heart containers
Man, it's freezing in this brick bitch, winter forever
Like Punxatawny Phil found with his four furry wrists severed
I walk face-first through the sex, drugs, and church
With
wild things that make Maurice Sendak
question his early works
But no hostages, no promises
Out to clock corporate cogs and sprockets
Not clogs, all grommets
Running from a rabid ring-wraith click basilisk
Serpentine, in and out of traffic jam and murder scenes
Scrub blood of the AF1s 52 Pick-up first degrees
Some toddlers smuggled tommy guns and crack into the nurseries
Dog, there's a fucking baby at the door asking for wallets
And those ain't twin Beanie Babies inside his pockets
2010's sonograms showed the magnum formed directly out the fetus
Evolution for the young killer convenienceThese wings have seen things most men would melt apart from
It's like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
All my drunk destiny pushed was one radio flyer chock-full of halo parts
Ringin this chime
like,
"Man, I could fix your broken shine
We're all Saints swept serpentine 'round charcoal tomorrow
Bunk holiday damned. Easy now, brother, I'm here ...
I'm here,
I'm now, then and there.  I'm, we?  Us?  Them?  It?
I'm sorry, I'm ...
God
,
this final extension's beautiful but, friend, I don't deserve it
I beg of you sweet Father please detach my chest's polar lining
I can't handle asymmetry
And if it means my grand finale don't tally the votes
Finish me, dormant, with torture-machine silencer-piece
Positioned where eyelids will reach R.E.M. well before I'm torn
I've never asked for much (Never) never felt golden-benefit worthy
I gots what I gots and what I don't gots don't concern me
I'm no model,
I never aspired to be Velociraptor fossil
Man, there wasn't no arrangement
Man, I never had a say in this
I wanna be the normalcy that normalcy was jealous of
No shimmer, no celestial flight mid-winter
Enter me now
See through Cretin low-life iris
(Uh, I, I'm, I'm not, I'm not ready) I'm not ready for all this business
that for some reason you all refer to as a privilege
Uh, take a look at me, my feathers drag, this harp plays out of tune
I fly about as straight as a blind tugboat through my legacy
I accidentally killed cupid with his own weaponry
And man that was my homie
Talk about not cut out for these pristine pearly robings
What could I possibly have done?
You really want me to steer child populace back on beaten path?
Oh god, like teachin morals!
I can't be a part of something I ain't soaking my feet in, man
I'm from the dungeon
So from here on out it's hark the herald nothing
Listen, I quit.  That's it
But for the life of me, one thing has plagued my being from the get-go
Why place these most blessed and sacred honors upon an alley cat like this
I just don't get it
Oh... my god, it just dawned on me... wait a second, oh... god...

You have been a witness
You have seen the days when
I applied lies in a billion different ways
,
and now I harbor bad karma
Doomed to cope with the fact I dodged the ring but gotta show these cats the ropes
Bad karma
Please leave these little wings to erode
Please leave this little halo to a child with a lighter load
I'mma hold this tight like a life lesson told through a micThe bully cycles dig the stitch in
Rig the hitch in golden theory
Teary victims walk in Slatters like my left eye astigmatism
Lift the bridge and sink
Link the fink divisions ink transmission with a jinx
Instead of tripping off the ways glitter blinks
Sinker
The book had mentioned several separate crafts that mobilize to clash defendants
The end-all installments dissolved in a Class A blemish 'n such
I'm touching oxblood skies over my city which hover in blue disguise
The dry season New York's five reasons flock to the marketplace
Targets chase targets oblivious to if they heart a splash of bull's eye
Games begin, blood, dread and sin
I'm crawlin soft, all of a sudden somethin' feels a little off
I nab a nauseating caution
Peddle on exhausted levels
Lost in identifying the unsure-edness plus the lord of morbid bliss
Tore in the cure that fits
I sit, lit up a lung, thoughts spin as I realize "goddamn, its I against I"
My name is Aesop Rock
Bulldozer-brand, exhibit-alpha bad Samaritan
I capsize rubber ducks 'n suck the merit in
Governed beneath the cherished checks and balances routine
I check my balance as routine, check balance in my dreams
Stress indeed this greed'll buckle flunk, and cling to the wrist
I thread the needle like my knuckle through the ring 'o my fist
Work out the kinks in my wrist
Weave up a tapestry so large it covered ev'ry inch of sky
So I cut holes for the stars - look up!
Hook up the speakers
I cook up another heated dirty lung devotion chokin with the ocean's bottom feeders
And you love it, 76 inches of sound
So ya'll could dig me six feet deep, my eyes'll still be over groundTelevision, all hail grand pixelated god of
Fantasy, murder scape bent perspective
Fuck a sore channel changed digit
I sit with a nasty network intravenous plan
With a stable diet of my cable pirate
Yo, the doctor is in, the doctor is on
Born the bastard son of static radiance cloned to welcome in every home
Lead a blue screen, bruised dream canopy
Victim of the cursed nursed Technicolor drunk support team
Ooh, I love all advertisements
Though accused by robot news casters who capture and pollute
Spoon fed hazardous fog to joy luck catholic squad
Please take me, please calm me, please make me a zombie
Please I want to donate my brain to the monstrous Panasonic profit
Now, twenty first century plagued
Dispersed to wide eyed glamour addict patients
Telecast patrons
Blue be the propaganda banners, well, sure I'll be a Marine
With a clean sword and blue uniform, it only takes a dollar and a dream
And I abide great idiot box power supply, fuzz vapor
Black out of New York, hey honey, get the generator
I'm in a doom, doom generation, pacin', ancient electric secret
Never sleepin' to miss the AM oasis
My name is a wired heart, sloppy obligation
Turn my stilt into my guilt and have a chatter box blame frame adjacent station
Make reality scrambled and suck the life out of a hidden vandal
And loving every minute of the gimmick, change the channel
Plug it in, turn it on, prop me up against the couch
Lights out, I ain't ever gonna have to leave my house
Satellite dish, get up on my wish list, turn me to a tyrant
Let my clean spirit dissolve through the appliance
Plug it in, turn it on, be my mother when she's gone, great
Wipe the spittle off my chinny-chin during the breaks
If I gotta go blind I'mma do it for the love of all television kind
And that's fine, and that's fine...
Make me a star, I wanna touch gold
Hold me suspended in a dream, merely inches from the screen
Deleted passions sacrificed to one electron monster
Crucify my little future to the monitor
Damn it feels good, turn on, tune in
Zoom in to hug the bug up in your family function
But the children seem to love it
Yes mother, me and wild discovery
And heard the static flock to where I sleep
By the glow of that magic box big speaker
Stereo mastered often kill the freak seekers, eyes spiraling
Tangled in the star spangled wiring
I can turn from toxicated visuals
And all the kings horses abort the loyalty to royalty
Fuck the fortress
Riddle me with glee, hoist the end all teleprompter above my sleeping head
I'll be dead by morning anyway
Color my values with mundane humor in thirty minute tickets
To feel the magnetic seal picket censorship
I want commercials twenty four-seven
I wanna shop from my bed and set an
Example for all my overworked, underpaid brethren
I bond with a six stringed correspondence
And lurking circuitry circus
With allegiance pledged beyond the glass surface
Adamant students within the fine school of possessed graduate catalysts
Channel zero addict
, immaculate
It goes-
big screen, little screen, any screen'll do
Just let me hold the controller and I won't have to murder you
Yo change the fucking channel
I burn a Coma candle
When the flame fades, consider my flatline a soldier's sample
We them cats talking noise behind that New York trash heap
Where the stench of commuter briefcase replaces a bad sleep
And it's, worker zig-zagers versus piggy badge flashers
Training Generation Fallout
Waterfall bricklayer pincushion crawl out
There's smoke in my iris
But I painted a sunny day on the insides of my eyelids
So I'm ready now (What you ready for?)
I'm ready for life in this city
And my wings have grown almost enough to lift me
I'm a dinosaur with Jones Beach in my hourglass
Passing the time with serial killer coloringbooks and bags of marbles
Don't tell me you ain't the droid that held the match to the charcoals
Don't tell me Lucifer and God don't carpool
(This is our school)
I'm not trying to graduate to life at the personalized barstool
Head in a jar on the desk, feet dangling in a shark pool
(Man please) Man please
My name stands for my being
And my being stands for the woman who stood
And braved the storm to raise the seedling
(Brother, sun, sister, moon, mother beautiful)
Yeah middle sibling suitable but far from son of excellence
Back in a long time ago, I was to way the wishes wish
But missers miss, I slept through my appointment
Saw the liquid dreams of a thousand babies solidify
And picked the rose that wilted
The second I introduced myself as Nervous
Well it appears the scars of learning have spoken
Some are burning, some have frozen
Some deserve tall tales, some wrote them
Some are just a brutal repercussion of devotion
Mine are all of the above cuz everything leads to erosion
Now where I live there's a homeless man, he sits upon a crate
He makes a rusty trumpet sound like the music that angels make
Now if you ever come and visit me, I suggest you watch the show
Tell him Aesop Rock sent ya just to hear his horn blow like this

And I ain't getting any younger
My knuckles wear their bruises well
I've yet to lose that hunger
But only time can tell
Prodigal Son with a prodigal wish to sew that prodigal stitch
And crucify bigot voodoo doll on two popsicle sticks
See your name is Ambiguity
My name is something hands can't hold
But hearts part ocean scapes just to watch the starlet unfold
It's like sketching a circle in the dirt with a pointed stick
Knowing the wind'll kill it some day, still it calls my burning wits for now
And if I plow the fields that don't guarantee plentiful harvest
But starving artists die, I set my alarm for five o'clock
Idols block survival crops the cycle stops for nothing
The Bible's carp revivalist winos flock by the hundreds
To the opening, scarlet carpets greeting their duel
Leading the stubborn mule to cruel rugburn
But y'all numb from gut fuel
I administer eclipse, there ain't no motor like a martyr-made motor
Cuz a martyr-made motor don't quit
I am an epiphany, I am webbed foot mammal
Channel surfing my way to the top
Tugboat in a bottle
With no holes poked in the nozzle
I fed em bedlam diluted in limelight
Till that rookie boogie graduated hostile
And the vehicle is grandeur and it veered over the median
The second my halo ran outta helium
Demoted to thorn crown, damn talk about numbskull
I was born bound to a stencil called symmetry
But my energy's a rental
So I take this now to say
Thank you senorita for holding a flame to a lost wick
Thank you James Anthony for the band-aids on my ego
Y'all are family for life
I'll take that bullet to preserve you
I wanna be something spectacular
On the day the sun runs outta batteries
Attach my fashion to the casualties of anarchy
Save my nickels up to buy that homeless man a brand new horn
Then sit up on his crate as I witness the beauty born like this
(I ain't gettin' any younger)That jackhammer is so real
Diamond cutter spine
Armadillo armor that bends around the blades
Bugs in the beard
Ebony in the lungpiece
Bricks in the Timbs
Bazooka in the tooth that he's flashing at your friends
This is the lifestyle, baby
No insipid recipes
Not a single innocuous atom in the centerpiece
Oh my god!
Journalists across the globe are officially critiquing my first eight bars
Piety for the fam, embargo piggybackers
Navigate sim-city backwards
Bazooka Tooth, baby!
Zephyrs less detrimental expect to tone down terrordome for starter crews
Like jousting Pompeii with a garden hose
If you wake up to the sound of helicopters bumping Wagner
It's Bodycast the Pilates class
Rumble in the Bronx back alley batting cage with bottle smash
Drag them prophecies
Be them celestine or Mothman to the bumper boat monster mash
You see the pristine kittens fiddle with new yarn
Decrepit sickly dogs get shot behind the barn
One champ put in long hours like
Tim Leary's lava lamps
Just to be second headlined under the boy born with lobster hands
Isolated, biological phenomenon
Verse nocturnally orchestrated car alarms
Y'all sketch portraits of your neighbors, tack 'em up without fail
See a row of red pitchforks and bifurcated tails
Official Max Fischer-Blume brake cable clipper
(Def)
Picket train buffer, the riverboat, and the switcher (Jux)
Pipe-dream of that so fresh and so clean plumage
As an
appleseed
aborted resorts to Bazooka Tooth shit
You don't want me smiling at your cameras
Yo
I take 10 steps with a bent left vision
Study the disorders we've absorbed inside the village
I understand the plagues and why they shake hands with my grimace
Then remain up in my face like top to bottom train car
fill-ins
Let's question the ascension of a broken social icon and bury its domino affect
I'mma blow this hex
over the mission
Just to administer the end-all sucker punch toward its pitiful condition
With no alibi love is used as a guide by the civilized
Some see it as the body heat you feel when you close your eyes
That's so much of a lie, you can leave your hair dyed and scorch your roots
As the truth hits your ears begin to cry
"Why Is It Like This!" Why the fuck do I care?
I don't have the answers, or at least the ones you want to hear
City lights look like bright groups of fire flies
Many see the truth (the proof) only when the liar dies
Tires screech to a halt, the ground cries
Spit sparks speak to the streets
The skid marks are replies
Read discussions of what we rode through entrenched in the vocals
The hopeless stay hopeful (the toxic fumes choke you)
As I walk out my door, step into the pollution
(I breathe in the problems)
exhale solutions
Physically the situation's hard to stop
I had a wicked jump shot and sold crack rock on back blocks
Casualties in this apocalypse (street chronicle)
Abnormal abdominals (push-ups phenomenal)
Relaxin drinking my 6-pack maxing
Faxing my thoughts on the satellite, via Donahue
(push it)
Table talk, salt and pepper conversation
Integrated sectors, metropolis and mecca
It's a conspiracy (you know), I can't lie dukes
Sometimes I feel the rats got a better deal than I do
It goes thieves, bandits, low lives, scum
Punks that buckle under the rumble of my drum
Steadily searching for something new under the sun
But its stagnant, active element first of madness
Thieves, bandits, low lives, scum
Punks that buckle under the rumble of my drum
Steadily searching for something new under the sun
But its hurtin, act of development first diversion
A new universe in ancient, so I stay patient
In a gravel pit, travelin thoughts unraveling, pacing
Embracing light of America, and found a shade of darkness (underground)
The traincar used to be my apartment
Sick of people rushin in the doors before I get out
Conductors closing the doors before I get in, I shout
"The blizzard's coming, the blizzard's coming!" ?
Don't get worried now (We've been in a cold world!)
We just getting flurries now?
Yeah, its like sloooowww dooowwwn
You're movin much too fast to bust through the finale fashioned glass
Its delicate demeanor and I teach you how to hang
But we like
1970 something 20 kliks outside Da Nang
(Dear Obedience)
I apologize for the faulty academics
But they placed us in a miserable stasis
I let bygones be bygones
But tryin to see eye to eye with the faceless
Just ain't working the way the manual paints it
See I soak in a blue note factory
While most cats hassle bandits lamping (?) solo
And when the last red brick topples over the earth
To intercept your crooked little mess
I can be found in a
social coma
directly to your left
Engaged in a conversation, a marvel with my breath
Regarding how to document the shady baby steps
I bounce checks like a modern man
Sleep with one eye open while the other two drift
Together specimens from the promised land
This for the thinkers
This for the urchins allergic to they own stingers
This for the absurd verdict linkers
This for that cat at my shows that's always got prophetic opinions
But can't remember where his drink is
I'm wallowing, shrugging I'm plugging your corporation
Cause we alley cats addicted to the sickly warped sensation
Answer this: when all is said and done
Are you a memorable trooper or just a lab rat on the run
Choose one
Well, so we meet again
(He said he's grown spiritually
Since the last time we'd spoken)

Ok, this is the dawning of the book of bitter aspects
Where the jackals sit and watch the pedagogues clash flesh
Poison function accompanied by six armor-clad
Black horse and buggy mechanisms
Tugged a portion of my severed vision (my severed vision)
The gathering of loose ends in a bucket
With a shoestring budget
Every man's got a field to plow (I know that now)
But it's like, man I really can't afford the oxen
Fee fie et cetera
I smell the warm blood of the bill collector knockin'
I get awkwardly sturdy with a frigid liquid backbone
I get swept in the pressure cooker tryin' to paddle back home
I get sprung with a vibrant alliance of clean intention
By eclipsing doom litigants hatched to bash these picket fences
Now I'll attend the wedding of the open sore and festering
And when the groom presents the ring
The bride commence the blistering
It's textbook magnificently crude
Prototype king
berserker
module
Inserted vertical thirst, burst horizontal (treasure)
Treasure, loose cannons span the starboard bow
Of the clipper ship dipped in truth famine pressure (pressure)
Cabin fever meter peggin' ludicrous
Beautiful cartoon troopers
Swallow brutal futility with a teaspoon full of sugar
I rock ready, aim, fire while y'all rock ready, fire, aim
Then blame the stationary target while the prey escapes the frame
Merit badge, marksman, or poacher?
It's all the same (right?)
So I lay across the wood perpendicular to the grain

I wanna be a big bang, gotta be
Never bottle me up in a probably, I wanna see a 'Yes sir', sir
YES SIR!
Thorn with a torn core, sore to the bone
Warn the other brothers I was born forlorn
Big bang,
Shoveling a big dig
Huddle in a tunnel of big dreams I think big things
I'ma burn with this little light of mind
And a prime concern to earn thanks, I'ma be a big bang
I wanna be a big bang, gotta be
Never bottle me up in a probably, I wanna see a 'Yes sir', sir
YES SIR!
Thorn with a torn core, sore to the bone
Warn the other brothers I was born forlorn
Big bang,
Shoveling a big dig
Huddle in a tunnel of big dreams I think big things
I'ma burn with this little light of mind
And a prime concern to earn thanks, I'ma be a big bang

I'm just a survivor of the woolly mammoth population
Bottle neck effect, sorta born def
Alien to shallow alchemy
If you gon' metamorph the base-metal to precious
Might as well steal from the rich, bewitch the peasants
I'm floating this homing pigeon out hell's kitchen window
Left an S.O.S. infested
bottle nestled in his grip so
With a prayer circle release party and hearty wild bellow
I observed him fly ten feet
Then drop the bottles to the devils
Fertile circle turned fertile crescent via bad investment
Despised every second, but I guess I learned my lesson
If I made an angel in the snow for every rotting victim
There'd be wings to float this mothership up out the goblin system
Sticky panoramic contaminant planted
In conjunction with phantom assumption
Gutterbug alumnus candidates
Well, I promise you I'll man the lighthouse
Just to help guide in your ship
If you promise to help pull this hook out my lip (bitch)
Godspeed, straitjacketed ragged approach
To circle suns via folklore pollutants derived strictly
From a B.C. generation disgust
Community movement alluding to a
"No blood given, no recognition"
Life manner, I was us up all night with a rusty hammer
Trying to build a fence around these magic beans
My dreams have gathered
But to, that certain lack of avail
I sail a choppy lot with buoyancy like a bucket of rocks (a bucket of rocks)
Yup! Steps up to the plate
Little brother, Little League, '87-he was 8
Rookie season for the skinny slugger newly out of T-ball
Pit against a pitcher with a ripper you could eat off
Church, then a grip of loons run to third first
Granny yelling, "Go Cubs!", nose in her word-search
Seen MILFs like apes on a monolithic bleacher
Into advocating war and peace in lieu of sport and leisure
"Hi, Peggy!"
I was 10, chewing on a Sweet Tart
Little brother, left field, queen's guard, mean arm
Knees bent, two out, two on bags
When I caught him staring down at something moving through the grass
Hold up; tagged runner, and the whole cast rotate
Not before he could identify the culprit
Granny yelling, "Go Cubs!" Graham yelling, "Gopher!"
New left fielder give a fuck about a homer
Got a homie, little rodent, head and shoulders out his hovel
No baseball in the bubble,
ruh-roh
Parents thought it adorable, the players followed suit
Inning crawling to a close,
head coach not amused
Coach seeing red, coach on the diamond
Dragging 27 inches of aluminum behind him
When he transverse third, the families turn nervous
The following is a transcript of "Man vs. Vermin"
Here we go: man stands out by a hole
Pest pops up to patrol
Man plays live Whac-a-Mole
In a scene that would try every child as adults
Whoa,
pall-bore with a ball mitt
Thrown over the fence, coach hit the bench
Both teams lose, "Good game, good game"
Granny yelling "Go Cubs!" Cubs ain't playing

My little brother is a funny dude
A lot of funny shit happened to him
My other brother pretty funny, too
Ain't seen him in a minute, though

The one, the- Th-Th-The one, the-
Th-The one, the- The one, the two, the three
Just in case of rough waters
I want to put one up for my brothers
Th-The one, the- Th-Th-The one, the-
Th-The one, the- The one, the-the two, the three
Just in case of rough waters
I want to put one up for my brothers

Yup! Not a part of the machine
Big brother, big idea, '9-0, 16
Neubauten tee, plaid flannel-laden, adolescent art kid
Tony Hawk hair,
Skinny Puppy denim
And a record player vomiting Alien Sex Fiend, Peel Sessions
In a Christian home for field testing
It's real youth in the palm of your hand
When your mom thinks Satan is involved in a band
We were buried in the Village Voice, checking who was playing where
Pulled his head up out the paper, pushing out a single tear
Five words, like a beacon of light in the mist:
"Ministry live at the Ritz"
It was "Christ Has Risen" to Chris,
three loaves, two fish
Miracle of mechanized loops on two-inch
Coming to a theater-he would be there in the flesh
Moms didn't say "No," but she didn't say "Yes"
Cop tickets-ah, the plot thickens
Countdown to ultimate concert experience
Ma still wary: "And why are they called Ministry?
Are they a cult?" Maybe she would probably investigate
Bought a mag with an Al Jourgensen interview
Read a couple sentences, glanced at a pic or two or three
That's all-no fair trial
Simply, "You will not be going to the show, and that's final!"
What occurred next were the top of the lungs
Of a son who, unjustly, had lost what he loved
In a moment that would transcend anger to high art
Said, "This is something I am willing to die for!"
Can you even imagine?
A death in the fam from industrial fandom?
Anyway, no body count, no concert
And Chris kicked rocks in his mismatched Converse
Yo, I surf an axiom kicked in a center fold by ugly tenements
Oh distribute sour inhalants regulate lobby developments
Today summon the rug rat oblivious to what's delicate
Tomorrow siphon imperfection out the fetus prior to selling it
There is a brain in the thicket tap circle
Cupping the port to accord it
Teeter thorn storm plunges more
But conformers the pouring's half the entry
Plated pearly gates a chanted axis
With high gentry hinging our binging on public picket fencing Squirming in terms in conditions of un-satisfact destiny magnet
Where the Ebenezer to Cratchit ratio tragic
Lose sight pseudo mavericks clash at futility pageants
I post froze in a blaze at a grand combustion
A leader's deception connection
Wiper with a barn responds his friend
With an eye socket full of needles
And a will to die for nothing
And that's glory
Abide thy crass itinerary barely suitable for common slum cats
And the lemmings will follow you to the blood bath
All aboard that awful train through shames patch
Where I'd trade my window seat
For one pane of replacement stain glass
See I bow to the the gods of opacity
I don't mind y'all looking in
It's just watching Sin City steam slips under my skin
And I'm about half way to nausea
Half way to contentment
2 halves post made a dance evoked a whole lot of resentment
Build a pen around Mastodon
Patriarch close to four peters
Woke to rope cubicles combines with combines suitably ingenious
Let's soak my feet in lake infinity
With a timebomb strapped to dignity
Symmetries vivid image still can't mimic the victory
Comfort is a drug and I'm numb as fuck
Yet some prefer the hum and
Others tend to suck the life out of the crux like

And I'm a tug dummy, hug the hungry
Pull the lever, push the button
Drink the garbage split the homage reap the harvest
Target everyone
Mechanized idols inhabit malleable colonies
'Till the fire ant dropped the sweet leaf, grief
Your dreams a needle in a needle stack
Claiming safety pin physics
Baby tin blizzards collide
While ole iron sides, trust the rivets
I'm sick of the pick of the litter soaking the spot lit
When I know they know they owe all thanks
To the end all Aesop Rock shit, watch this
Oh, build me a home
Build me a home of brick and wood and everything good
With a front porch where I can jar fire flies by night
And smoke stog's till the day meets twilight
Build me a home
Build me a home with a green grass hill with running water
In a backyard with a sandbox and a garden of foreign flowers
Build me a home
With a basement and an attic
Where I can store remnants of the day I once slept in
Build me a home
No skull is sacred in the races
Locked in a pagan doctrine
Watching born again faces gamble up patience fail blatant
Ochre and sienna war paintings stain plague community
Harking as wrapped, it's overlooking out crops
Give you one life to laugh at catalog bliss
On the least common attachment
Ten seconds of blaring silence
Pilot is flight redefine stagnant
Most emotions host an entire lesson
Congressional, less one
Stone merely for the exceptional spectacle now
Listen the pause heed tall falls the voidance of the suit dispersed
Where the straight and narrow's a perfect circle has-beens
Fastened to the flip side via migrating clusters
That's better than colony
My own father's son is the holy ghost, suck that theology
High king for a day or peasant for a pleasant life
Blood on the easel and my eagle eyelid spots runaway pirates
Look, I despise squatters with a, oh, cry me a river
A quarter how'd you afford that dog and sour dialogue
I put my hook in the pond
I put my worm in the hook
I put my trust in the worm
That he'd bring me something to cook
I felt a tug on my line and I lugged a trash can
On my pole with a note from the worm attached that
Read, "Thanks for nothing asshole!"
Simple parables of nature making character giddy
And riddle me a similar situation mid city
Quick, put your honor on the line
Doors to the monks blood thirsty barracuda serpents and
Report on powers of devil treatment church links
I'm a fence sitter
Lips torn by both polars and their working
I can only model throttle at the dream catching
Matching a patchy holist with a sovereignty
Harbored and charged by hate breed anonymity spigot
Spitting stitches to fix the bridges and the gaps
One night I broke in
Bridges give us traps and
Tried to walk to get stogs just like hop scotch between polar caps
And I'm, blue in the face when every second is a waste of breath
Making that classic mockery of every step
Oh, build me a home
Build me a home, please, with a light in the window
And a red front door and a picket fence
And a fire place and a sturdy frame
And we can sit and I'll tell you my name, build me home...
You don't wanna be some old dude
Shaking a fist at the new bold youth
You were the new bold youth, now you some old dude
You don't wanna be some old dude
Wagging a finger at the new bold youth
You were the new bold youth, now you some old dude

And I know you know I'm sucker proof
Mediate the over under, leaning over onion soup
And soda... Armchairs, Underoos
Camera's on the entrances, TV's on The Bugaloos
Speaking of, what's up with you's? Y'all tried chilling?
No, whole time bow tie spinning, like "Hzzzzzz..."
Cough cough sputter, not to worry, there will always be another
I wanna say I nurtured all you little green settlings
But these lapses get the guillotine snapping, it's distracting
All-righty, play me what bumps
Yuck, I'm getting too old for this, shucks
Aes stay gold for this much
Gray and mostly tits up
Old man winter, eyes on the prize
Give the lowest of lives, the highest of fives
'Cause...


Wassup breezy, it's the brush fire
Put Vicks on my chest like I'm Russ Meyer
I love Breyers, but I'm dumb tired
When they say "based," I say "safe" like an umpire
They say waders are lame with the brush binder
Daryl Hall hair is bald as a bus tire
Janitorial and we're sore when his funk fibres
Start moving pip-squeaks like I'm Keith on a drum riser
Up in the club krumpin' - what up shorty?
"Yo, what are you, like 40?"
That's a whole other story with rips in the root page
And if age is just a number it's bugging it's room mates
Like dudes, keep it down you're driving me Bruce Wayne
And I'm three floors down and still hearing your 2Chainz
Oh that's One Direction well regardless dude
It's not Nas getting live at the barbecue
So tomorrow dude just keep the drama calm
Because it's not funny when you call me Big Papa John


I am not here at the Raise A Roof or Parallax for feral cats
I'm in the same age group as Darryl Mac
Ask these slender teens if the denture cream is in stock
Engendered of remembered dreams in my inbox
Of  denim jeans or Gwendoline's like, "Pick rocks"
Now my bum knee and limbs pop like rimshots
And twenty-something's hard to compromise movie tropes
While my aftershave is some homogenized Uzi smoke
So how can I optimize the booty stroke
While my sole possesion is a fossilized dookey rope
I mean I got etchings in my worry lines
But how the dream rings off the the precipice of thirty-nine
It's depressing, some pre-dating toe tags
Spell checking in a suicide note drafts
Y'all pull vintage tees out of them tote bags
I got a vintage me that is visibly cro-mag
Raw, I'mma give it to ya, no trivia
Raw like that Aesop rock iron-fisted bliss militia
A bent funny bone, drone community
Spit a thousand and one ripples to cripple the continuity
Tapwater builds character. Right
I irrigate it straight to mainline
You want to do the same? Fine
These pretty profit grommet teams solidify to clot the slippery city sump piston pump drain
Behold "Old King Credible". Kind soul with a Russian-roulette bad mood spin-off
Where every day, a thousand strangers pray for empty chambers
One sixth buckle
Five sixths sweat bullets trying to keep it subtle
But I'll get you (I'mma get at you)
My novelty, wobbly rope bridge broke inches prior to dry land
But duck skull stepping-stones suit the mix down well
Well, when the rumor spreads that y'all stupid
I'll be the cat with guilty look on face and shirt that reads, "I didn't do it"
God, is it on? Is it beyond basic?
Does it ice-grill you? Or is every song faceless?
Does it have a title? If it didn't would you name it?
Does it babble about nothing like a drunk atheist?
We could run that Orwell's '84 warp for the Room 101 detour
Until each client fidgets with his or her own worst fear specifics
Swerve around the cobra kisses
See if the venom overloads this vision, I'mma suck the poison out and spit it
Stole my sneakers but your feet just never fit in
Serves you right for trying to walk a mile outside your limits
I'mma tiptoe across this yo-yo string
Until you walk the dog out from under my feet and skip town, sit down

It goes boom boom boom (x4)
Boombox (x4)
C'mon

I originate with the drums

Earth to A.R. vertical
Burden has increased at an alarming rate
Bliss is down a point, murder up, glee down, and still falling
Still crawling out of bed at 2 on Saturdays came this blind soldier-burning confessional
Ease back, let a heart thump echo normalcy for 10
Let the back burner boiling point descend
I race the derby in the first heat (strike personal)
Strike personal space with a most utterly putrid version of grace
Spit the gimmick, sit and fidget wild
In five you'll be jumping through hoops like Coney Island freak show midgets
Want to be a fighter pilot?
Driving that childish early Wright Brothers experiment prototypic model fossil
Sitting sweating bullets on a console
Busting accidental dirt bike donuts outside the most ridiculous poison tongue brain silo
Dead before the chubby debutante conquered the high note
Schooled by the cruel intention invention's pensive sideshow
See contrary to popular certainty, I alone advance
Without an earthly poem, and dance on a handful of zoning fans
Combing every chance to own the land, I roam with dome in hand
And truly be its only camper happy with the scrap heap
See I convince myself it's on, therefore it is
And the melody settles beneath the fact that I'm just spitting for these kids
I tried to get 'em all open, and once I quit and said I didn't care
That's when they all threw their hands in the air
You can't eject the new soy bomb
Boiled tongue that hop out the foil swan
Clock in, pull a coin from the koi pond
You're a pull-toy, bon voyage
Yeah, boy, I'm a lame from the paint chips
No slave to the grain of the trade winds
Phase in, deflate the whole snake pit
Gotta hunt, got a hunch y'all ain't shit
Layup off of that lightning rod
Over shaking those icy palms
Brief announcement, I'm peeking out
If I feel surrounded, I might King Kong
Even now, defy moderation
My streak allegiant
My body failing
I'm east of Eden, not holiday
And these feet a realized sovereign nation
Each free to Watusi and do so duly
At night when the zoo get toothy
A once and future goon, own the exit row
Burn the leeches off, throw the second stone
Note the pest control, claw the peepers out
Hold the telephone, shit
Here go thirteen loops in a rope
For the truth, what it do, what it don't

At the coliseum grown numb
Hello as in what have you become?
I cannot have been the only one
I cannot have been the only one
Figured y'all would never pony up
Slither off into the going gone
I cannot have been the only one
I cannot have been the only one

Born of an elusive baboon troop
Horseflies that backstroke the boot soup
Show up like an eyeball in a moon roof
One false move, dude, you're a food group
Old friends turn flames to the hayride
I was kind of unimpressed with the AI
Get gutsy or crushed in the canines
Bring a steak knife, bring a trail guide
Breaking out of that boarded house
Faking normal has worn me down
Hit the road, an old misanthrope
Alone,
tip me over and pour me out
Cozy up to that pressure cooker
My heart's a bottle, my head's a butcher
My blood a mix of both milk and sugar
I push the pencil, no pencil-pusher
Kid been had toxic folk in a sphere
Kept it afloat, I was frozen in fear
In the closure, the ghost just won't disappear
It make the whole globe a road to nowhere
Joke's on you, I'm going nowhere
Still, 5-0 is, "Woah there," oh dear
Stoney bologna, drum the undo
Two score plus, never been a stuffed suit
You look like you were charmed out of a basket
Slack jaws
clap straw homes
Hit the piggy in the clapper claw zone
Each a little Isaac Asimov
Actually down to accurately whack-a-mole
And get the taxidermy cataloged
With or without this bag of bones on my back
I'll be honest, I let a goat eat the map
Still agree to bleed a birthstone
Even if alerted to the dirt throne
Freely by your tentacles squeezing into a turncoat
Yikes, inertia days and vertigo nights
It's when a batch of falling gavels
blur the vertical stripes
You ain't a leader among
You're a bottom feeder eating his young
We'll see who's teething when the beef is expunged
Unless it shrivels up around us in the caving wake of daylight
But more likely you slither off into the closest drainpipe
Miffed, other insiders are finding solace
Thought it wasn't ever in our quarters hoarding shiny objects
Degree in beeswax never personal
Which by the way have grown exponentially indiscernible
Behind a picture in the wall or at the local pissing hole
Where desperate images sully every second an empty coat
I'm gonna guess you probably know everything I could ever tell you
Plus a tiny bit more
That's what you're for
And you never met a button that you ain't push
Or a sucker that you ain't mush
Or a mother fucking butcher

The, the, the butcher
The, the, the, the, the cleavers know exactly where to put you
The, the, the butcher, the, the, the butcher, the, the butcher knife

When out of focus go the handlers
Answer to the hammerheads that camp under the scrambler box
Swam off with a plaque for mounting antlers on
Outpost scanners
Of a yellow desert peppered with cow skulls and cameras
Down fall the phantoms
And a tale drawn long by a crown full of raw flawed canvas
You should see the cough cough annex
And D-up when your lullabies are peaking
For the succubi that fawn over a good commandment breaching
Alright sleeping
25A, feeder full of chicks on horseback
Sailor Moon roof spewing horn hats
Born to corner any harrowing defector
Vector, through a delicate series of tech gestures
Check, hood on my hair, foot on my neck, food in my trough
Stewing the nuances of hooligan law
Ran reds like a primed gazelle
, priced to sell
Because these window sill pies don't heist themselves
From the tucker, home of the dozen bee sting summer
Don't let them see your gills blushing seaweed color
Chum, this little medium is dominant social predator fun
It's really grown folks coming undone
But um, I'm gonna guess you probably thought this all before me
But better and with a more elite view
That's what you do
And you never met a button that you ain't push
Or a sucker that you ain't mush
Or a mother fucking butcher
Hey, yo, must not sleep
I bash the bracket open and breach
The priority's bleached since that '76 umbilical severed
Majorities cordially abhor the pinnacle vendors
I got West Nile virus on my TV in the Bronx
I got two hollow pockets and a sleepy hollow mosh pit
Tryin to blow the spot with wet matches and bottle rockets
While cop walkie talkies squawk outside my apartment obnoxious
Tonight's special consists of stale fiber from shitty diner
Look mom! I learned to tie my shoes! (Hey, can I borrow twenty bucks?)
Peel back the prickly cocoon to Poloroid turbulent land unit birth
Student first pedagogue only from brazen action
Wind blown mariner east river shark parry lunge carry funk endzone caliber
Watch war face painted jukies dance blissfully around a bonfire and sacrifice live sanity
Pay a nickel for nose-bleed seats in a peanut gallery
Gallop with a pegasus
Malice with no benefits
Balance with some sense of bliss and the foulest degenerates
My New Year's revolution's gon' be to stop burning bridges
I'm just 'gon bend 'em toward the couple cats that's worth the visits
And um, it's like that, and that's the way Aes thinks,
and um
Plans are like clipper ships, if they got holes they sink
And if the skipper slips the crew shits bricks, wither, and hit the brink
That's why I take the poison's bitter sips and smile big when I drink
You never knew mayhem walked with Nikes, talked like a trucker, hawked the filibuster
,
Gerber baby lucid Colonel Mustards
No time to hold my breath (Nope!), I'm only here to rap, eat, sleep, grow old, and smoke
Stoges through the hole in my neck
New millenium, mad cows and Pentium
,
process the hostage, lock him in the petting bin
Show him pictures of his wife and kids, then wash the brain
Probably the same motherfuckers that buffed the trains

Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay
Must not sleep
Must bash the bracket
Pay the rent, pay the debt
Must slash the fabric
Catch the jackrabbit
Pay the rent, pay the debt
Sleep
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay
Must not sleep
Must bash the bracket
Pay the rent, pay the debt
Must slash the fabric
Catch the jackrabbit
Pay the rent, pay the debt
Sleep

Roll into the city with one half of the cannibals
(whose that?)
New joint bumpin out the whip speakers
Made the escape for a night of making tapes now it's back to the cockroaches and preachers
Somewhere a prom queen's giving birth in a bathroom stall
Hauling a prime directive not to get blood on her mother's ballgown
I'm son of a stubborn old one-track jackal
Brisk, truckin' with prime directive just to get the goods and never fall down (Raw bomber!)
Ate the city, spit the bricks
Ate the boxcar, spit the burners
Ate the planet, spit the murder
Funny farm brain patient writing rap for milk money, built ugly
With a couple side effects to make'em love me
My cipher demeanor left Jesus rubbin genie bottles
Til the following morning Colombo found a crown of thorns in urine puddles
You're in trouble!
I'm not trying to save the world, I'd rather watch it die slow
So I could spit my grand I-told-you-so
Are we having fun yet?
Yup,
step to the carnies
Try to win a teddy bear to impress your favorite Barbie
She almost sucked you off at the company Christmas party
But she won't accept the bear 'til Aesop signs it with a sharpie
My ex-girl bounced without payin' the cable bill
I checked myself in television rehab
Withdrawal symptoms may include shivering, fevers, drooling and chronic masturbation
Now I pray to the gods of pornography and Playstation (No!)
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
Give my ASR to El and bury me with my mistakes
This is my friend Tony
He's pretty cool, although he's not always so smart

And then they were eight
Just like that, just like that...

(Back-back Pluto, Plu-Plu-Pluto)

In the beginning it was Large Marge sent me, I'm bent
Empty the rent if you can double park the garbage barge gently
The moon took a second mortgage on the seventh house
And Jupiter ain't talk to Mars, he felt the host of rovers sold him out
Close your mouth, poke your snout over the cloaked aroma
Clouds
,
Solar boy elope with couch ogling older Polaroids
Motor mouth, chauffeur the golden molar toy
Gophers yoke a fish out of water, he grows lungs and multiplies
Idle when soldering a perfect union
It is vital to calculate any ornery loose ends
So if mutiny ensues the aloof is assumed nuisance
The clue is in his vacancy, the proof is in his goosebumps
Maroon the traitors expecting acres of edelweiss
Who later learn it may actually be safer to play with knives
I show up late looking project grizzly
Two bowies, a third for throwing and accomplish dickweed
Nothing, nada, nill, I stuff a lot of pill to gut
What's the proper rules on stuffing hostages in trucks?
I'll be numb enough to chill before the choppers spill the blood
But if I'm not! (Hmm?)
Fuck it, plug him, warpy got his goddamned groove back
Jet-setting on spec with a dead yeti on the roof rack
And miscreants will rubberneck jalopy euthanasia
Which will later be regretted when it's your turn for cremation
And I walk like early man, freak a little witch hunt
Gathering the carnies and exploiting every stigma
The malformed oddities among sovereignty's normal
Shall abuse every vice you can imagine right before youThis is my friend, Tony. He's pretty cool
Although he's not always so smart
(Aesop Rock)
And then there were eight (then there were eight)
Just like that

Jupiter ain't talk to Mars, he felt the host of rovers sold him out
Close your mouth, poke your snout over the cloaked aroma cloud

Motormouth show for the golden molar toy

Idol. Once soldering a perfect union

The first step is a doozy
,
it's roulette with a mood ring
The birth of an old slang, the death of a new speak
A permanent post-game is littered with bridge trolls
Skirting the copay,
divvy the death toll
Innumerable codenames, alerted and mobile
Familiar rising, a furnace and coal pile
Resilient style kings, impossibly tantrum
Wandering wild things, opera-less phantoms
On linoleum or lava, leaders of a lead-foot fauna
His left source blunt force trauma
Not a pillar of the commune
,
a splinter off the pagan
Who wrote on the elusiveness of truth and exultation
From the point of view of students labeled putrid little aphids
By the
beautiful and cryogenic stasis: sadists
Meanwhile, makers of a hideous whatnot
Committed to a lowdown Sisyphus up-rock
Are shaving at a truck stop, aging exponentially
Homie, no myth, flowers grow where he piss
And I still row boats outta bottles without abandon
To shrink into the sunset
bumping Pachelbel's Canon
In D, motherfucker!

May or may not be weeping to an automated pharmacy-
"Hello. Hello? Shit!"

Too geeked up to even keep it down

You wish you could dance more, I wish you would talk less
My gentlemen transform to bringers of off'd heads
In moments of land war,
a Lazarus species
Tattered and bruised up, the back in the cheap seats
Hack his own crew cut, foam at the mush-mouth
Gag at the news truck
, notably unsound
Dragging his clown shoes, food in his moustache
Raggedy hounds tooth, zilch on a bus pass-
I'm good! House at the beach of expelled hubcaps
Black lawn, backyard melting into Lovecraft
Bad yarn spun by the hum of the bug zapper
Of kings becoming runners, and runts becoming alphas
And underdogs with posters of a front-side Tony Alva
On the sticker laden walls above their uncle's Bowie albums
Of
graduate to flyers of an execrated sigil
And live to see another sexy generation fizzle
Out.
Keep rap homely:
Bear claw slippers, over-sized Billy Joel tee
Fat-faced, potbelly, neckbeard, crow's feet
Rat nest, gross teeth, pock marks, go team!
I walk with Hawaii on a greenscreen behind me
So even the awkward pauses feel inviting
Standing at a landmark sleep drought keep out
Can't talk now, too freaked outThis instrumental was released as part of

Check out the song's lyrics
here!
Mash the buttons, knock knock, never yield
Phobias in motion blowing smoke into the sterile field
Wonkavator up beyond the seraphim, terra beneath the keratin
Every bit precariously jerry-rigged
His helmet is a case of Bud, he factor in the paper cuts
Corrugated cockpit, I'm not exactly Major Tom
Buzzed Aldrin, I can't count backwards
Ten, one, someone get this buzzard to the Matmos
Ten thousand hours addressing open beaks
Exiting the atmosphere with no green to chroma key
Greebles on the body, tin cans on the bumper
Slip into the freezing ether like a pea coat from his mother
How much interstellar freedom can he reasonably suffer?
More than you can feed through a shutter
I use a phony voice when I'm yelling, "Nobody's home"
I'm a liar, but I wouldn't say I'm wrong

I ain't really seen land in a minute
AWOL spaceman, wave to the Mrs
Faint transmission after nothing for the summer
I have never seen so many colors
Uh, ayy

The human heart tattoo move in a hard vacuum
Only back to pay a bill or maybe fill a cart with cat food
I'm shredded, smelling like I just stepped off a charred capsule, I did
That's not imaginary ash in his wig
That's rounding Cygnus with a souvenir from galaxy quest
I know it sound like myth and magic, but the shrapnel commits
I give a fuck about a factory scent, we mostly play to the fringe
They figure, "What's a little tape on the wings?"
A little glue, a little paint, a little staple and string
You won't believe how far the garbage when that radio ping
Behold a view or two where you could lose your voice at the moon
I hope you like your beef and veggies with the moisture removed
Dig it, the low rider, lower the gold visor
Nosedive guided by the ghost of Laika, my heavens
Slow drive, side-eye stealthy
When can we expect you?
Why would you expect me?
At night I wear a wolf's head on my regular head
Consider an irregular character sketch
Food hoarder, communes with the flora
Computes in cahoots with beauty and brute force
I've got a brand new normal at a thirty in New York, plus
Years at the fire pulling portions out of corn husks
Never mind time on the short bus
Terrifying errant knights thwarting any motherfucking fork tongued-sport
Agita
flashing the hind molars
,
though his body less a weapon more a bag of lipomas
Over medium,
treat skin-tags like scratch-offs
Rap like black-ops,
rappers like lap dogs
He got the rad moves, catty alpha rat-proof (wait)
Twenty-sided die at the crap-shoot (wait)
Looking for a black hole to casually collapse through
Try aisle nine by the cat food
There it is
Ooh wee, do we roast in a bilge, when the skinny from afar is "Thar be gold in them hills"
Time better let a couple truths decay, or somebody going to rue the day
Check, check, check

Catch 'em on the lam
(I ain't joking)
No maps, no muster point
(Nah, I ain't joking)
I put a pebble on a tomb
(I ain't joking)
Making bath tub meth
I'm joking
Here we go

The whip got a tongue and teeth
Too tough,
two blood-shot eyes with a
Tungsten
bleep
When any putrefying arrow wants your lungs in reach
I field a vessel going zero to the fuck y'all think
And when your function fails I'm on an undisclosed island
Stroking exotic animals
,
open up rocket science
Leaning a jewellers loupe over a stolen sock 'o diamonds
Palm-made products a portrait of modern triumph,
try us
Back at the battering ram post-haste
Cro-mags,
wait till this Saturday plans grow legs
All you hear is intermittent code names
Ricochet around the geometry of a closed space
Unfrozen part of his new J.O
Face of divine evil, heart of Camu Tao
Some people find the daylight to be oddly alluring
I was in the dark, dodging and burningThis instrumental was released as part of

Check out the song's lyrics
here!
I was a dark, dumb student, no hooky rookie
Day tripping on visions of chickens that look like R. Crumb drew em
They grew em in a royal dirt of Suffolk County's
Flooring with the blood of an alcoholic clergyman in his forearms
Long Island was porn stars and puppies pushing sniffles
Fit into the aforementioned or slipped through the pinholes
Zook slipped through the pinholes
Crispy the God sender
Who thunk over a quarter plunk to local Mortal Kom vender
Both the formal squad censor, look down
Either side across the marsh before it was awesome cars
My calling card cavalry cooking an '85 Dodge Ares
Gas for Huntington and back barely
Equipped with Super-Soakers full of piss
And an uncanny knack for constantly upsetting pigs by doing stupid shit
The kid piloted his ring king
dummies to
King Kullen
Where he hollered fuck the world from a parking lot in the suburbs
What's this
A couple spray cans and a little litter
But they'd look at us like swindlers with them
Ricky Kasso jitters
So fuck em, a glutton sunk into the alley for props
But things will still go bump when them halogens pop
Believe I'll be there when it happens
The shaking of the plates off the mantle
The snaking of the flames off the candle
The lady of the lake off the answers
Admitting the mistakes to their deplaning cadavers
Now it's rest in peace Will Peterson whose heater sung disturbingly to
Further re-evaluate your beast of burden's urgency
Damn doggy, good times, thanks
I wrote your name in wet cement by the
Brooklyn Banks
What's this

I'm an activator
Made a fire, made a wheel, made a snack for later
Catacomb kids cuddle up and test the flavor
When the towns speed freaks sleep
Trap the traitor, he will ask for papers
What's this
Say I'm an activator
Made a roof, made a weapon, made a flag per acre
By the snotty little muzzle of a
latch-key neighbor
When the folk push aggie over some dap with gators
He will catch the vapors

Couple Playboy mudflaps and hell on his heels
Beautifully echoed in the pace at which he shovel his meals
Like not a farmer among us had a harvest survive the winter
So dinner split a lima bean in triplets, pick a winner
Took a couple summers puking pills behind the dumpster
As the largest Pez dispenser on record recouped his numbers
One shoe in the soupy gutter
One shoe in the velvet heaven
Where the mermaids told him shake em by the lake of melted weapons
What's this
You could dance purty with the hooligan nation
Who will be patiently awaiting zoo-keeper facelift
Extra the days of yore painted similar uber-ape shit
We've merely updated the ancient 8-bit
Yeah I'm dumber than a cow on a roof in a flood
Who's not as dumb as the watered-down beef from the burgers that jumped
I'm dumber than a Taz on a beach chair with a martini
Who's not as dumb as the tat wit the same scenery
What's this
Sparky nails
pig stigmata for all good sport
Garbage pail kids
unite at the mall food court
They chase cheese fries with Binaca
They had shut the school down early
There were bombs inside the lockers
No concept of the problem
We responded like a snow day
It was clobber shit to flotsam
Til the cops said it was okay
Okay show the squadrons back into their boxes
Like his
Breakfast Club
of hotheads show no progress to the doctors
And I walk into the office, coughing awful ether often
Flood a parking meter fever,
knuckle up for Love and Rockets
It was reign of the razor laser
Day of the cloudy howdy
Flight of the shelter melter
You can bow without me
What's this
I stood before the glittery borders of new radius
In search of the fabled city of mud and crushed velvet
What I found was a gutter where the love of entertainment
Meets the lust for blood and demerits

Cutters of the pie
throw your summers in the sky
Collar-pop Jolly Roger die motherfucker die
Apache on a ship shape, in Bristol fashion
Snuck a jammy through the red tape and tiptoed past him
Worm teeth grinding feverishly below
As little organic hacksaws eager to feed and grow
So when it's Blackhawk over the glass walk
They surface up through the cash crops
With clippers for your belly-up mascots
and
never dine alone
Meanwhile, back at sea level
,
it was home by home zone for zone
Bloom County's homeless riot for home ownership
I hope you put gas in the motor-home and know the roads
I studied with the finest combs stuck under my thumb
As opposed to the loaded nose who pray Armageddon is numb
And that's unevenly rendered
To those who grew up thinking faith was a surrender of reason
But not a reason to surrender
Catch the Liberty Fire's catalog
Forty torched orchids and
citronella for Algernon
Don and Vagabond alike repent
This shit should have been Beta burns Babylon, the end

And when the radio stars climbed up out of the floors
To murder the medium that shot 'em thirty years before
They said
Kill television
Kill television
Kill television
Difficult isn't it
And when the cutters of the pie throw their summers in the sky
No love lost baby, the future is so bright
Kill television
Kill television
Kill television
Difficult isn't it

Nothing says charm like an armored car
Taking the clone-farm 'tards to the arms bazaar
We were the homemade marker makers born to pour the marsh ink into right guard parts
And march through the gauntlet of car alarms
No harps, no delusions of losing with something prettier
Than ash around the metacarpal still clutching the teddy bears
But we can run with scissors through the city fair
Or situate the nuzzle with the subtle art of splitting hairs
Double park the shuttle, some will arc the funneled cutty sark
Where budding narcs target the gushing heart in the muddy Clarks
These are the vices of the
p-noid bastards
Who will chew whatever tablets blur the axioms fastest
But crews lose lunches by the hundreds
Lose electricity, lose gas, phone, plumbing
Humming keep your mouth closed
Keep your cows cloned, go
I am the pulse of this fucking town homes know
My what a convenient embargo
At least I'll always know which side of the gun I'm supposed to buy the farm from
The too-far-gone kicks, still in the box
Fix, still in the pill in his sock
Chilling, gill in the slop
and a million watch
Gideon
scribes
But once the arc honor pussy and bribes, the animals will divide
And that's a win for the garish who keep charity in the parish
While profiting off the lack of a marriage amongst the classes
We don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie talkies
We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee
No, we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie-talkies
We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go

And the last shall be
First to immerse in the pass out heat
Face in the mud where the moxie melt
'Till he woke up drowning in tchotchke hell
More in a cave with a torch on the wall
Than a window arrangement of porcelain dolls
On a brand new day, saw what he saw
Property owners who crawl to the mall
With a bad toupee and a face like he author the law
Pace like he mourning a loss
Right hand on a can of worms
Left full of gold he will trade for turf, I mean
That's ok, you got to answer to you at the end of the volatile day
But a model of mercy and might, no way
Marionette who will clap and obey
Dude, look, all that noise
Call that flight of the water boys
Meet and greet and they all slap five
Cheek to cheek when they colonize
And a grown-ass man shall abide as he wish
Walk that path with a dime and a stick
Walk that path with a diamond and wine
Walk that path to the firing line
Just walk, pay no mind
To the new recruit with the play-doh spine
Let's be friends from opposite ends
Wave to the kid don't hop on the fence
Play to the radius far and away
Orbit wide don't park in his space
One little martyr who talk in his face
Make one little
Weathermen
sharpen the blades

We don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie talkies
We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee
No, we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie-talkies
We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go

And the last shall be
First to the curb with the
mad cow meat
Face in the bars of a regular cell
When he woke up high in collectible hell
Boom town kid who was taught by the binge
That a man who expire with the most shit win
That's warpy American nonsense penned by the rich
Not a routine friend in a pinch
Still not used to the stench
How it throws off otherwise lucid events
In the case the afraid observe
I got a Pro-Keds box full of layman's terms, it goes
Hey, peace, pray for the plagued
Major relief and capacious rains
But just cuz I don't want to war with you
It don't mean go warm up the barbecue
I'm like pardon you,
sawed off limit
My high noon is a quick little minute
I don't wanna spend it sitting with a critic
Who simply isn't going to ever really get it
This HQ is alive and alone
No driveway no sign of a home
No dial tone, no line for the phone
No world's tiniest violin song
And I might just lie to them all, lie in the morgue
With a deep breath hiding and bored
Fighting a smile, highly annoyed
When the timing is right I will rise and record
Call for the monster beats and Blockhead got
Animal drums like he's doctor teeth
It goes red light green light 1 2 3
One large coffee, fuck you, peaceAnd the last shall be
First to immerse in the pass out heat
Face in the mud where the moxie melt

It goes red light green light 1 2 3
One large coffee, fuck you, peaceI now present to you
Music, music, music, music
Music to make you stagger

I've been a
biplane dog fighter
Henson invention Trooper
Burst the result of Dragon Ball Z/Speed Racer gene splicing
Mach force, blind the extorted style from the common dirty
Destiny dream sighting, important as split the prints
God shit the planet screaming "What on Earth is that?"
I sit back five dimensions
Only to mostly over cook the specimen
Vending tragic fatality successful dodging volleys
All Hail Mary's and Hello Dolly's!
I flow ridiculous, indigenous to now
Who holds the fifth golden ticket?
Tour the wicked war phantom mansion beyond the pickets
The house next door to when the stickball clears the fence
Y'all hesitate to fetch it!
I was walking through a pinball tilt built landscape
Pterodactyl circling turtle
I bite the bullet in a wingspan shadow
Suck and rust the oxygen in gulps
And spit the metal directly back up the barrel
We ice grill the silhouettes (right)
The common decency factors a lowball estimate of zero
My testament is striking B-Boy stances
Dancing past the foggy mirror
When wiped clean, the billy goat beard camouflage the spirit
I'm at six degrees of sexy sarcasm
Yeah, never swam up inside Summer Jam classic
Another bent backwards bastard
Scouring the carnival grounds for an outlet
Who the fuck is Aes Rock?
I'm not a name to keep at arms length
Adjacent to little Linus quilt makeshift
Sick security mechanism, check your mission
I am not a vision, check your mission
Just a simple sour patch delinquent
No it will not help you shove your Lincoln
I fell asleep again
I wasn't ready for it
Yo

The harvest appeared less plentiful than last season
I imagine sloppy seed handling evoked a stroke of tardy planting
And the crops we'd have harnessed mid-November
Had only brushed the blossom bracket
Then soon sacrificed
lives to icicle jackets when the frost hit
I sunk to find the warmth
beneath the mosses
With a plan to tunnel past after the rains have run their courses
But alas, the portraits of these frostbit corpses tortured in the grass
Offered this torch supporter one tall glass of nauseous
And I'm asking you: Why's the spy supply hiding in strangers
When they know atop the food chains I could spot biters for acres?
Now be gracious, these minstrels turn a bully cycle civil
By dissolving the candy coated image down to the pixels
The upbringing of self-styled freedom brigade investors
And their studies connecting one hit wonders with dust collectors
Puts it down
It's down beneath your sappy sing-a-longs
Let's take it further down, we'll let Dante decide which ring I'm on
Nova
The elders took positions and the fans marched
Parched, plain and steamed
Hawking the rain in my canteen
Now I'm like point:
I guess I could spare a splash for a couple of heads
Counterpoint:
During my famine I never got broke your bread
Well, equation of intrigue, yes, yes
Lemme fence sit for a bit
These tense lips need soaking before I hand out tokens
Shut the fuck up
Drama like kabuki with a heart of dirt
Skull fucked cross bones hence my birth
It hurts

Must not sleep. Must warn others
Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers
I milk my habitat for almost everything I want
Sometimes I take it all and still can't fill this pitfall in my gut
Must not sleep. Must warn others
Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers
I'm tryin' to walk on top of sunshine
But it's ridiculous at times. That's why I'm touring with this warning

Crowning the glory of our advance
Fire ants to water beetles
These Freemasons adjacent to pacing pins and needles
Pupil turned pedagogue,
benediction to my dream
Beaming a billion bottle rockets off the golden mezzanine
Check it
I'll pluck the petals off a classic blood rose one at a time
Gripping the stem in the right; invite the thorns to dig up in my lifeline
It's a metaphor for nighttime
Ante up the slight cost of exhaustion
To salute the moon above
paradise lost
and you're a spectator, stringent
Inch by sacred inch shoveling coal into my earthworm soul
(You should know!)
Burrow up through the dirt with bloody digit
Lick my knuckles clean
Noting the corporate clusters holding hands
'round the abode of the damned
Now what's your poison?
Starlight in a maser with a nicotine chaser
Sip it clean, savor the taste to sit and dream later:
The eyelids pivot back upon the hinges
20 miles across the glassy eyed window of wonders to passers by
Now I'm 6 foot 4 with a 6-floor walk up just to recline
With no free time. The alarm storms at nine
My daytime's on some, 'Yes, sir. Ok, sir. Right away sir
Sir, do you mind if I breathe, sir?
Oh you do? Well excuse me, sir, fuck you.'
I breathe slow
I run in with these fantastic amalgams
Painting casket-bound careers to peers gunning with classic albums
Security's the javelin, catch it
Labor
Clocked in in '76 and haven't clocked out ever sinceCook it up spooky salute
Look 'Zook'll hook it up
to
Shoop the local Winnie Cooper loopy
Low brow, low brim
She asked me, "What's your name?"
I flashed the grossest fang in show biz
Young Valkyrie
is open, "What's yours?"
"Um, Jenny, um..."
Body clocked in a ten-penny sum
Sprung colossal, "Miss, may I process your Pentium?"
But Ae is hesitating
"My princess
The pigeonholing rose out your predecessor's lunacy in the kismet"
Her eyes googled back as that of one unfortunate breed plus a new kink in the posture
"Just don't get all barnacley
Or get P.T. Barnumed in 3D THX sound stereo dismissal
Sorry hun, it's just the last few have been a fistful
Like.. like them girls you bump into out dumb luck
Get high and innocently kiss once when she's punch drunk
Watch her misinterpret the moment tongues touch
Crazy McCling-a-lot claim instant one love
And you've gotta beg your friends to take 'em off your hands like thumbcuffs
Or them barbies you'll vibe for a sexy second (lovely)
Give it a month Hyde heckles Jekyl and she makes Hitler look cuddly
But Jenny in the sky with emerald eyes
You're so different so delicious so the fish
I'd be willing to walk the limb with
So let's just get a few things out the way: (okay)
I'm clinically bonkers and hate just about everyone God's great earth offers
I won't be getting dressed up to impress your family dear
And if I can't wear jeans and sneakers then I won't be lamping there
Nope, aggro-pimp, sinfully, finicky nova, bag it up no-diggity soldier
Magic touch fingertip donor
Own up to your dirty debutante animalistic instincts
Ritual courting dance and breeding behaviors (like what?)
I dream of Jeannie and fucking her obsecenly
But Jenny could be Jeannie so easily if you'd let me
Hell, the bad tact daddy-o Merlin-- 'e' for effort
Most of these high-post Fabio world motherfucks make my head hurt
Dead up-- I got death in the skull but you'll get used to it ma
Dinner and cinema, yes, just cough the bread up
Sure, he schleps with a naked pocket but I carry dreams
Like I wanna be an astronaut after you marry me"
(WHAAAAT???)
"You're rushing this
I feel smothered it's crowding me awfully"
Dolly, I love you, "Get the fuck off me!" Sorry. (Call me)
And I'm circling her like a tiger shark frenzied but friendly
"I'm cool, how you feeling Jenny?" (Jenny?) Jenny? (Jenny?) Jenny?
"So quiet, oh I like that, so mysterious, I dig it
The way you haven't made eye contact with me once in ten minutes
I'm just saying girl, I'm dirty-dog raw vintage mixed with mega-low society
Mister gutter-fuck etiquette - try me!
So there it is, game. I mean it's not like I'm sweating you
Because when it comes down to it, most of y'all females are the same
But now it's your turn baby, spit it out"
"Okay" She punched me dead in the fuckin mouth and walked away
Platoon of sappers advancing toward the barricade!
Troops behind them, fifty men or more!

I target the crux of all that's considered sin
The lost child venomous neck that spittles off my chin
Color me what?
Spellbound man hunting hellhound
Special investigations set kingpin
Bounce and of course you're happy
Mic activist, axis
Pivotal point spun all too often
Now walk and spin cycle
Dug psychedelic syndrome jabs your abdomen
I'm adamant with disperse and curse across
You're playing your chances broken branches
Scattered around your mainframe type uproot it
My hand saluted eastward compass is spinning
Magnetic field my metal mind driven
Threshold fresh coke crush and affect
Mic check and spin a rec conglomerate
The all absorbing metamorphin' monument
Not that average once upon a Glock, Glock, Glock
Dot, dot, dot, et cetera
The heated mass of fire and gas threatens your retina
Burning you back to immobile twitchin' fetal position
Itching for what could have been if not for who

This is Aesop Rock
I'm with 50 million troops upon my side
Flying towards the fraudulence coordinates
One hand on my mic
While the other drove my flag into your sidewalk
My sprouts stalks pawns and then I'm gone

Close encounters of the first kind
Contact cursed minds
Skies red
Stuck sitting spinning world wide webs
Overwhelmed and worried, flurried on your sidesteps
My pride treads thick
Utilize wide lens I slide strength in-telli-gently
We utilize mic like skele-ton key evidently all is not well
In a metra pot sell
Automatic hell habitat
Tainted pollutants toxic to me
The melancholy-olly-oxygen free on the night watch
Boost I introduced y'all troops to tragedy
Radically millions morphing the orphans
Spitting distortion
Piteous portions lacked a guiding light
Overriding and striding through the night
Starry army extends mics like dendrites
I blend life's darks and gray shades
Till displays made illustrate my views on sanity
If you're feeling famished we are family
Aesop Rock the canopy seek shelter
I have weaved a web across the sky hovering covering all
Night crawling audio visual veterans
Spreading like spores through the homes of all average Americans
50 million poets screaming all on the run
That's 50 million hearts beating as one
Ayy
I could give a fuck if there's mold on my daily bread
I'm a foe to the fainting goat, I'm at home on the razor's edge
Over the garden wall when your Rover was playing dead
Arm-in-arm with a melancholia, roses and baby's breath
Slow to reveal a signal from deep in the tub of tiger balm
Lighter lit, giant slalom circumvent the psychopomp
Womp womp, circle to the watering hole
Something secluded where the spoon stand up in the joe
Pursue a puff of smoke who never hum or trumpet his post
From unassuming to the poltergeist of multiple homes
Ultimate weapon, slow the pulse to a crawl
"Sir, we had thought he was toast"
That's when the elbow drop from off of the ropes
Family approach him like he sat up in his coffin and spoke
We only talk in awkward hello after awkward hello
Most of my visitors request that I be tied to a chair
I wear the skin of my detractors, maybe try not to stare
Yeah

Every time I look up from the paper
I see animals exhibiting irregular behavior
Even though I know that it's a warning
I am back on my old shit again like any other morning
Every time I peek out from the corner
Birds are flying belly-side-up, fish are walking out the water
Even though it seem legit
I'm right here til the season dip
I ain't seen shit
I ain't seen shit

My gang sign's never the same twice
Since offering his service had him nursing a snakebite
We dabble in certainty, I'm allergic to grave vines
You certainly unearthing my aversion to make nice
I'm basically bored stiff
Your sortie go from orbiting warships
To cowering in corners, "Mother, make us some warm milk"
From 'bout it to the mayor of Snoresville in a jiffy
The final form's a portrait of a squirrel stuck in a chimney
I buy a second seat for my extraordinary piss and moan
Feet up while the fleet assemble, keep the devil in the hole
With several yelling, "Sparta," you were yelling, "Marsha, Marsha, Marsha"
Only one'll read the chapter after larva, it's a good one
I'm haunted by Atlantic water bade adieu
Balancing a billion rocks to levitate adjacent to
Escapist at the undisclosed, aloof and newly mummified
You're upsetting the customers, you should see the other guy
Wait
Does it feel you're the coward of the year?
You're the coward of the year

I'm so laborious, bright
Its a wreck in dire vocabulary
Adversaries will commence to ignite like magnesium oxide combined with peroxide
I'm hazardous, poisonous, the carbon monoxide
Earning stacks, gold/sterling plaques from burning tracks
Your learning that if your unconcerned with rap no turning back now
Man I'll bomb you please from up in the trees
I'll freeze the season with a tighter squeeze than anacondas

Ayo, one heart plated with purely golden tiles
Mixed with a little mischief, behold style
Load a back alley shaman liquid Tomb Raider with a most fertile assortment of spitting logics
For the lab rats gone colossus in the spotlight
Now Aesop Rock be the handle
While your breath control is tough, to breath along is not enough
I correspond to a kick snare blind, but share the passion
But a small percentage of the masses and their fashion

You've got a feeling that you got me where you want me
I've wait within the palm of your hand
And you've got cartoons in the morning while I'm sleeping
I've just got dreams that I don't understand

Supply the checks, Known from Cali, Chi to Lex
My respect and styles some try to get, but die direct from the side affects
You crave Perc cause I'm well equip with predicate
Your too delicate for this fella flip kid you better get saved first
Called freaks give me no floor feet all sweet small peeks
Cause my stocks exchange they bore street still the slick
Kicking the illest hits who kill us quick when I build this?
Spit more rounds than Bruce Willis flicks
Ideas and flow raise eyelids that's why kids make hybrid rhymes
Supplied with step this God did years ago to grasp a taste
Have to place them in a glass case and observe 'em from a Nasa space center with a mask on face
Coward of the year make others fear the way this brother is empowered
I am the bomb, don't try tampering with my brand of style could by stand
The only witness ??? is God's (this guy's) camera taping me
Birds of a black
Black feather stick together forever and ever and they always remember you
And all of the shit you do
They pass it to the baby birdies and then they remember too
Little baby blue eye's eyes turn black
Without forgetting the face of the guy in the mask
When you see me baby will you scream or will you laugh?
Little baby blue eye's eyes turn black (x3)

4 and 20 gory pantone black crows shredding innards
The silhouettes are fencing lefty scissors
Separating horn and hoof as evil's own arpeggiators
They piggy back the tombs of all your deadest friends and neighbors
Buy the getty image, green-cheese moon
Dead-of-winter shit
,
graveyard tchk! tchk!
Shifter shit
,
brother was a face card
Crown like a heart-shaped tunnel of woven branches leaning in over his
hydro-plaining
pace car chase...
Wait up let me isolate the bass more
Gate of god's acre
Aim to rake the snow off each forsaken name here
Supposedly closure'l free the vipers out the bosom
Personally I think it's a bunch of bullshit
Prisoners,
tradition is for lovers
God forbid he flip the witch against her coven on some 'dip or play the dozens'
Now I baptize skips in larvae and dental records
On a little plot pregnant with 6 million sentence-enders

Little baby blue eye's eyes turn black

OK
And the tech support for tragedy's emphatically horrendous
Teenage operators explaining what bated breath is
Pass, I wish it were something I could diagram on a napkin so you won't feel so detached if it should happen to you privately
Publicly your shadows'll cat call back
Happy to split the button eye and burlap doll
Crack the crypt
Bats eject like cousin death's wing-ed lapdogs ricocheting sonar of the sacrilege
Now let me slow this whole shit down for all you half-goat cowards
I'll even grit my teeth for you
I am so completely off the god-damn grid it's not a question of addressing me
It's "what do these symbols under the dresser mean"
Perhaps a little dash of karma chameleons through the entropy for good/young
Could've used a good lung
Still, proximity to corpses wasn't nothing to the kid but unforgiving science or cinematic horrors
Fast forward, my knee in the gut of a glass coffin
"remember that cow in the dean's office?" seems awkward
And I know your people donated pints to the same pavement but for ash and bone to share a space with strangers seems outrageous, ain't it?
Maybe a dialogue of howls that reshapes the jowls and face somehow relates to whatever you have found among a thousand cloned shrines
Either way - dope stone lion

And they call to let you know your friend is dead in a box
The crows have the tools to get the meat out of the box
Scientific, ritualistic, headstone cold foxes still rot
I'm not gonna rot, no, fuck that snot
You can let them let you rot, man
But I'm not going to watch
I'm not gonna stand atop your plot
I love you friends, but I'm just not
On the other hand if your ashes are scattered in the sea
I will swim in the sea and you'll be with me
And if your shit is scattered at the roots of a tree
I will climb that tree
Watch your step, Watch your mouth
We all know the way that a punk goes out

4 and 21 crows
None go south
For the supper when a punk goes out
Checkerboard of mothballed death-forms
Hauled via vaudeville canes
And encased where the claw marks wane off broadway the god way
Watch, our father
Commuters from the farms with news of
el Chupacabra
Who transfuse soup out a fresh punk skull
Dumb full blood suckers
Only the chum suffers
Pine box butcher
Encouraging poor lighting
Said "a pall bore's not a sure sign of jarred lightning"
Harsh, that's how the yellow spine-diner was born
Feral feeding that strung his organs up like tire swing art
Chippin' a drippy set of broke bone grinders
More for the hive mind
Less for the land mine finders
Fine, no defacto leaders in the eatery
Unless you count the way they led his heart through his tuxedo tee
Straight out the front

4 and 22
Cue the cut throat mouth
Chew together when a punk goes out
Etiquette of tart-tongued ghouls
Never run truck jewels
Run a culinary school for gluttony-drunk wolves
In guttural grunts
Smothering buttery lung ramen
Early sign of punk shows up on the diagnostic
Hm, pardon if I seem stand off-ish
All the see-sawed loss, I can't call it
All petite drawn straws and orange caution
Or outcast creeps re-involved for absolvement
It's gaudy
,
plus when a hell-bound offspring and yours share
an office, all
evolves salty
Watch, if fortune is a bitch with venom and laser tits
Maybe sin 'll make for sugar-flavored flesh
Kings taste terrible at best and rest in peace raw
The rest are recipes
Caw!
Caw!

Watch your step, Watch your mouth
We all know the way that a punk goes out
Gotta watch your step, Watch your mouth
We all know the way that a punk goes out
Carry his own water as nary a known other
Read a palm when I parry apparently no sucker
Man slash island, casually hammers iron
Falcons that come to daddy, fabulous cash and prizes
I'm back of the theater, feature feeding rapid eyes in crisis
Out of sight is both his fancy and a random act of kindness for ya
Ride the wild aurora, future bright as fried Gomorrah
Present tense an SOS in tidal water, final offer, sold
I been shaking off a death rattle
As a window-bound bat from a collapsed red flannel at night
Flight path managing a back and forth
That draws a heart and dagger if you track it all with tack and yarn
Six foot a million, nothing off the rack fit him
I dress like
fingers of light through black nimbus
Ruined last Christmas, probably ruin this Christmas
You can follow it from wing to cataclysm, listen
He carry his own water as nary a known other
Burn sage in the alley with various ghostbusters
Sea of disembodied bones knocking on your rods and cones
Some resort to scuba gear, some return to hobbit holes
Me, I done a lot of both, riding out and running scared
I'm everything from, "He's a pest," to, "He's been dead for twenty years"
He's been shredding perfect curbs and golden light with total scum
Pigeons bring him donuts, I'm the motherfucking chosen one
And every time you liars talk, fish and birds start dying off
Roses turn to solid ice, quiet eyes to fireballs, um
I started spilling all my problems to the final boss
He shed a tear and let me by him like, "What's mine is yours"
Broke him off a little weed
Bid him well, off to see a system into smithereens
Sniffing out some livers he could lose in a broth
It's when he go and pull the hood from the hawk
You look lost
He carry his own water as nary a known other
Go halves on the carrion, carry-on bolt cutters
Not a towel boy or cow to the slaughter
I leave an awkward conversation like a cow to the saucer
Inspire a thousand Our Fathers, people start calling their priests
"We've never seen a man so vehemently drawn to the beast"
"I heard he plays a pipe organ and changes form when he feeds"
I've never played a pipe organ, the rest my lawyer concedes, okay
Pull up at the Spirit World, zero man pit crew
Itching for experience clear of the jellyfish bloom
Show him to the sickroom, sic him on the showroom
Show us how you trick 'em into swimming through the au jus
Devil's trap on the welcome mat
The dinner jacket smell of hell and back
I'm working on my hell and forth
It's bound to be a bumpy ride
Deeper through the death and gore
Coming out the other sideBaseheads locally approach all spark plugs
Total disregard for a dying man's shark jump
Post-meridiem pretty tungsten attracts any once-pale horse painted gunmetal black
Face masking, hard-shelled ebony propeller hat
Clubmans, gloved rakes grappling the clutch span
Tuck go the steel toe, metal gate spreading
For the dead-alive that rented parking space 37
2000 out the weekly under "Cycles to Gehenna" gets him floating over 20 busses
Fireproof and festive
Corners like a two-tired tiger so a too-tired rider can accumulate a few excited fibers to assign
Knows no zen in the art of maintenance
Only as the orchestrated patron saint of changing lanes baby
Here is how a great escape goes when you can't take your dead friends names out your phone

Eyes and teeth, new moon on a scale that defies belief
Outside what our fundamental sciences teach, every other mighty lion asleep
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth

The man-ape translates glam thru the visor
Goes in water lillies
Am-scrays Giger, and man-ray
Crammed in a one-player campaign
Blinker like a hallowed bonfire over Samhain
Span where the praying hands mandate
Bars an extension of the arms
They're mutating instead of being farmed
Tonight beneath a marmalade venus
Haunted mowers chewing every glowing yard of mud between us
Going Ford, Jag, Datsun, Corvette, Lotus
All cones you can slalom when your Zorlac's focused
Via mechanical Dartmoor Frankensteined poorly
And sanctioned by a New Yank Yorkee
Who knew that any moment he could lose it to the decopaged suicide flooring
And still he keep his fuel tank portly, the 30 odd year old gears thank charlie
The scarf thank Mom's new hobby, kssssht! copy

Limped up like a dog with three legs (shut-up) to the stage...
So many dark arts to choose
You can focus to the phobias involved in forty hues
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Tune into the prudence of the
Dark Heart News

Breathin's a tug of war, wet when I rush the ball
Flushed
,
29 bust
gum stuck, clutch the door
Slumped in the back burn Bush by the son of George
Sweat tear and feed
cause I don't bleed when I cut no more

A system of gods from each of the brawling tribes
So my bible is a pot of qualms, clipped and collaged
Pavlov's bad dogs parry mass bells
I don't speak the language but my last laughs held

Spiraled get vertigo, signals the flash and beep
Postin my head for myself to get back to me
Pouch full of dynamite, blast cap anatomy
Bags full of smelling salts
Mad as the magazine
attack
Medic, Stretcher, Call
, cracked, Crazy,
Header, Fall
A threat, a break, a mistake with a pulse
Pickin' every last fuckin piece of paint off the walls

Okay the rotary corner grow to be notably mobile
And social gopher teeth form holes
Or any scene where Brie is normal
We'll locate every exit, had seconds to flee the wormhole
When emergency diversions ring the celly or the door bell

Burning it at both ends, friends let's commiserate
Turn it into something to the sound that the triggers make
Born at the baddest sign, half this time, still awake
Training all my zeros to perform like they're figure eights
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And keep on, 'til the break of dawn
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And keep on, 'til the break of dawn
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And keep on, 'til the break of dawn
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And keep on, 'til the break of dawn

Put one up for
Shackle Me Not
,
clean logic procreation
I did not invent the wheel, I was the crooked spoke adjacent
While the triple sixers' lassos keep angels roped in the basement
I walk the block with a halo on a stick, poking your patience
Y'all catch a thirty-second flash visual
Dirty cooperative med platoon
Bloom, head-trip split ridiculous
Fathom the splicing of first-generation fuck-up
With trickle-down anti-hero smack
(Kraken!)
I pace my game for zero hour completion cretin, splash
Duke of early retirement picket dream
American Nightmare
hogging the screen
I'll hold the door open so you can stumble in
If you'd stop following me around the jungle gym
Now it's honor, and I spell it with the 'H' I stole from heritage
Merit crutched on the wretched refuse of my teeming resonance
I promise, tempest-tossed breed with a bleeding conscience
See, the creed accents responsive but my sports divorced the wattage
And I'm sleeping now - wow! -yeah, the settlers laugh
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when the buzzards drag your brother's flags to rags
You won't be laughing when your front lawn is spangled with epitaphs (You won't be laughing!)
Then I'll hang my boots to rest when I'm impressed
So I triple knot 'em and forgot 'em
His origami dream is beautiful
But man, those wings will never leave the ground
Without a feather and a lottery ticket,
now settle downThis be the dawning of
The age of dead water
Station every B-boy fragment
Somebody live enough to bust through the belly
Put a fist up
This is a right-now generation murdered by the fanbase
This is adored by the writers
Dead water
With a still-force activated
No, I'm not feeling alright
Formed by the village of badges and bad karma
Punched by the stagnant waters
Leaked through the fickle whack
But by the window sill's three nickles in a piggy bank
Honor with a hint of funny stomach from the hunger pains
Splashed automatic B-boy with big visions
In a matchbox apartment
Adjacent a crooked starship
Spoon fed a nation in millions, the only remedy:
Nine deadly planets with a bullet-riding centerpiece
Take me through the gates!
I'll find the stink of burning
Find the hottest slacker in a visionary costume
Con-artist
Kamikaze conduct
Gone for a second
Till divinity whored herself to disaster
I recognize the takers
By the mechanical stagger
As opposed to the skip of
Big Brother
Badge slasher
Theologies who seem to keep the jukies caffeinated
Like a Mad Hatter had to sleep now
Ask after
Calibrate the happy-scale
Weigh me soaking wet
With a mouth full of dead ideas and see if it tips zero
Stripped ego
Tall stories of brawl glory
I'll be God while you're still living life on a full 40
Or maybe I'll be grimacing, homes
Poor, broke and lonely
Hidden by my billygoat beard and cardboard monstrosity
I drink a bad glass of gumption
Not bad meaning bad
But, bad meaning ... disgustin'
Wild child
Activator
Activate
Sludgin' up the dungeon for an accolade
And while one documented wild murder
Flamed through the city with a wild merger
Woke up and a wild-style burner!
Space-case
Boombox
Hate-tapes
No lemonade breaks
Sweat and no cheddar in Labor Days
Right now
I'm here to break apart a Bic's piston
Plus my "straight and narrows" got more curves than a Russ Meyer vixen
Spitting sob stories to confront my thick addictions
I'm the dirty basin with the graves of Salem witches
Driving my stake through the face of painstakin' business
Checkmate
Wanna scream misery?
Better breath-take
Out of sleep
Lifted off the botany
Little Jackie paper and a magic dragon sack of dirty shrubbery
I be the ugliest version of paranoia
Kingpin set in motion
By the secondhand pressure
Some get excited when the Sun folds under
Some get excited when the summer hits the pavement
Some get excited when the bullets hit bones
But I'm board
I'll escape through the train yard
And sleep till it's broken
Alex up the street called, said he saw a bobcat
Keep the pets inside, notify your contacts

New Salem
Brave new voodoo
Wave a witch hammer in a haven for the woo woo
I'm paper china dinner, mostly picking at my stitches
The bloody hair, bad code, bunny ears, dad jokes
Bitch about Lamictal to whichever vixen listen
The skin rash, the schism, a million rash decisions
In truth, he had a capital T terrible 2 days
That chewed his plumage to the root
And proved a prequel to malaise
A feud he knew was brewing blew up in his face
He'd been replaying the scenario for days
With the variables replaced
Meh
Loser in the sky with more diamonds than the carpet from the Shining
Part riot, part Orion
We jarred a lot of lightning up
Shook a turkey leg or 10
Maybe we deserve a day of rest
Not to mention...

Alex up the street called, said he saw a bobcat
Check your trash can lids, notify your comrades
I said, "I'll take first watch"
1 AM defend the whole block

The coyotes, summon the ghosts of blown diodes
Open and moving like a luchador with no eyeholes
Fried while the pipes froze, life goes Lovecraft
Christ-pose, sitting on invisible hubcaps, up
Call Alex back, daggers in the basil patch
Tell him maybe less badminton more Scrabble Dash
Less Jarts more Rummikub
Whatever keep the scallywags wrapped up in the subterfuge
Gussied up, guarded, and wearing the same armor as the night he argued 'til he dapped his mans up at departures
I could drive into a lake of fire
Pay the piper COD
Aware the pot and kettle shop a little toxin equally at least
It's probably more the kid than the kid
Either way a vital widget in the system is sick
A sea of symptoms in the hinges hit the room all at once
All I can do is plug the roof with my gum
For now I gotta...

Ayy

Pulled pork sliders
Headed for satori in jorts and horse blinders
I'm more for the sordid,
got nan for the normies
Cornered, my storm got plans for the Dorothies
I storm off, forged from my gramp's war stories
Short sword swinging like a dance floor in the forties
My oars both row in a ocean of fringe science
The low road's owner of the most pinched lighters
I maybe got a thousand
My crane kick plays like a train through a mountain
My neck chop plays like blades on a frisbee
All tally-ho, had the whole place in a tizzy
Is you widdit?
Fake name, wake made of windswept village
Visit where the simps get skittish
Some get a signal to the ships in the distance
Most get crickets, it's slim pickings

Folk say I'm difficult
I'm too stubborn
It's funny, I'm real easy
Y'all buggin'

I like film cameras, and slim chances
, and
I always put the chips in the sandwich
Yeah, bitch, picture a hiccup in the curriculum
Clearing off his coattails, tones yelling, "Finish him"
Stone-faced, always with the same two sidekicks
One, no, both are comedically oversized fists
Pack a wallop, I wallop a whole pack of punks
Pretty much a grizzly plucking sushi out the salmon run, Troubleman-ish,
I'm an apple with no tree
I'm ground swell crashing every castle at Jones Beach
It's beautiful as Jolene hair in the sun
Or any adversary wrapped up in an area rug, oh, Jesus
Aes loves all animals and plant life
Songbirds eat from his hand, you goddamn right
Odd man out, bad hand fanned out
Trying to man up, man down

Folk say I'm difficult
I'm too rigid
It's funny, I'm real easy
Y'all trippin' (Ayy)
Huh? Who's there?
Dog at the front door barking at the air
Wind all "woosh" in the trees
Then, "chk-chk-chk-chk," feet on leaves
Uh, it's probably a cat
Might be a guy with an axe
Might be a trap, shit, it's probably a trap
Might be a possum in the trash
It's probably a trap
"Ayy, keep it moving," God, I sound stupid
Good chance I'm not even talking to a human
Then again it's probably a trap, somebody had to set it
Depending on the type, maybe several
Yeah, that's it, it's probably several, several come together
To make what would've taken one forever
I'm thinking it's a pretty damn sophisticated trap
Utilizing some technology I didn't know we had
Hmm, maybe I am entirely tripping
It might've been the neighbor's kid, but I have my suspicions
I wish it were as simple as a critter, but it isn't
I feel that it's important we consider all dimensions
Like, oh, I don't know, maybe it's a trap
I step onto the lawn, y'all jump out with the bag
I wake up in some alley on a wholly other plane
Can't remember who I am or how to get back to the base
I realize you people think that I am off the deep end
I'll say that it's a lovely night regardless of the BS
It is, a perfect snow is freckling the path
It's almost like the atmosphere is begging for a trap
The mutt goes quiet, one last sniff, lopes inside
Fine, it might've been a baby squirrel who tumbled from the nest
It's probably just you motherfuckers missed
One one one one one
One two and freeze, don't nobody move
One two and freeze, don't nobody move
One two and freeze, don't nobody move
Don't nobody move, don't nobody move (one)
One two and freeze, don't nobody move
One two and freeze, don't nobody move
One two and freeze, don't nobody move
Don't nobody move, don't nobody move

I spell 666 star six nine click
Give his telephone a Viking funeral, bye bitch
Treble hook two birds, cheap thrills, free meal
Vacate Jellystone Park with your brie wheel

Now he sells le cars in Monty Burns' Cazal Frames
Half his life was likely to be Nikes on the L-train
Gnawin' on his dog toy,
pocket full of deer blood
The only thing that's stoppin' him was Dokken in his earbuds

Up around noon
Found everything he loved crushed down to a cube
The new Kowloon chowline
, two leads routing medicine and gruel
One is hemorrhaging money, the other jettisoning fuel
Identical water-separated pools
It was clever
But it wasn't ever neighborhood-degenerate approved
In swooped jukebox Fonzie, promptly
Bolts on his neck, one tubesock wonky

16-panel head mutton chop and Ambulax
Double pits to chesty
got the ESPY on a camel's back
Handle that Huffy wit' a timely parry
And get all up in your kitchen money, Guy Fieri
Question: If I died in my apartment like a rat in a cage
Would the neighbors smell the corpse before the cat ate my face?
I used to floss the albatross like Daddy Kane with the chain
I'm trying to jettison the ballast with the hazardous waste
The kid is comfortably numb, routine a tedious crutch
Steep in a self-imposed Stockholm and Lima in flux
Maybe an occupation popular with demons and
ducks
Made any mingling akin to being seasoned and stuffed
It's a theatre of jumping jellyfish, jealous little sycophants
Miserable and flimsy from the skippies to the pissy pants
Each one separately convinced
They're sketching with Da Vinci's hands
Delusion turned the communication to prison camp
You fucking dorks ain't a threat to the cause
There ain't a lesson we can learn from the ostensibly lost
I think it's funny when defendants from identical haunts
Step out the tempest, a measure of what the spectrum involves
Maybe no one cares
Party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

I used to hang around with rappers at the root of the scene
It meant a lot to feel the fugitive community breathe
Maybe to sentimentalize is to be truly naive
I know some shit about your heroes that you wouldn't believe
I think we're all a bunch of weirdos on a quest to belong
This song's our echolocation up in impregnable fog
That's why it's odd to see a pile of imperfections and flaws
Ascend a pedestal to patronize the rest of the cogs
In a mess of obnoxious fantasy, posturing and pageantry
I ain't even mad, I'm impressed, shit it's baffling
God almighty, chop an ivory tower to piano keys
Play your own dirge on the way to surfing maggot beach
You fuckin' dorks ain't a source of the art
You can't be cooler than the corners
Where you source all your parts
The poker-faced, all it takes a couple sordid remarks
We let the manticore out, We make the sorcery bark
Life is so unfair
Party over here, I'll be over there
I don't feel a thing
And I stopped remembering
The days are just like moments turned to hours

If I died in my apartment like a rat in a cage
Would the neighbors smell the corpse before the cat ate my face?
I used to floss the albatross like Daddy Kane with the chain
I'm trying to jettison the ballast with the hazardous waste
The kid is comfortably numb, routine a tedious crutch
Steep in a self-imposed Stockholm and Lima in flux

I think it's funny when defendants from identical haunts

Where you source all your parts
The poker-faced, all it takes a couple sordid remarks
We let the manticore out, We make the sorcery bark
Life is so unfair, party over here, I'll be over there

I view the rattling of sabers like a show to expose
Insecurities exploding in emotional code
When braggadocio to go from mostly jokey to gross
Corrode a homie 'til his probity is notably ghost
Before the hobby was a job, he was a miniature hell
You would wobble round your momma like an infant gazelle
The disillusionment has truly been a difficult pill
But you as anything menacing is a difficult sell
In a whistle and bell-o-rama
Black mollies that dress up like piranha
It's not even compelling melodrama
It's a comedy, somebody wanna shop you as a saga
I'm very voluntarily persona non grata
You fuckin' dorks ain't the leaders we need
This ain't the medium for divas out to weasel and breed
I'm offin' coffee with the paupers over tea with the queen
Don't make him show the regency what disobedient means
Heavy load to bear, party over here, I'll be over thereA swamped rat in the labyrinth huntin' derriere
Skeletal vessel crafts where the liquid meets the prairie (right!)
Limp a long, spill it, his speech is bumped into infantry
Simply smiled about it and ran victory
My tenant blanket the banquet
A thank and a jacket
I sank into my prayers
Let the steam roll of the lip of the kettle
My flying-contraption drips in a bucket
A bum drunk with nine planets that circle planning
And won't even share a cup with the Sun
The flow commits ablaze harassment of my entrapment fragments
Opened up all ears leads towards mild display adaption
I'm old, the creak of a rusted hinge notified every market place common apart the dust pan
That are roped in a slogan picket but can't finger their motives (right)
Surgeons work their shifts with queued suits broke in the motion (right)
Storytelling casualties is magic on a rotten day
"But we already know the one about the fish that got away"
Man, I walk a bridge with tin cans, with both my flags within hands
Barnished and tarnished skeletal frames sentinel devil tin man
Cannibal taught me about an iron galaxy where I sleep
Yeah but I'm trying to find that if my tin-figure is special or obsolete
I dash with dreams with an attraction to the captions at the bottom
"Here lies a tailor made slate obstacle"
I can feel the remnants of your devilish smiled offered a slay
But I'd rather play the Sun and let it fade
This is not your ordinary ballad
With a perfect little bow around the middle
And a black knight on a white horse
Or a white knight on a black horse
It's got all these tired parts where
We don't even sing
and random
Princess raise the drawbridge
We don't serve your kind
It ends where it begins
And the beginning isn't pretty
Can't forget that not-so-perfect
Bow around the middle ('round the middle, 'round the middle...)
And it goes a little something like this..

Moon walking a broken soul pedigree incessant
Gut the cruddy frame
The zealots enveloped inside the belly of the blame
Cutthroats the result of pulp jokes soaked in poacher constants
And not a jewel amidst coal wander prominent.. honor (honor)
I bought up silkworms by the bucket like starter kits
Sew your first martyr stitch
Join damaged mammoth brigading caper
Nurse the tantrum with a fantasy chaser
I keep the spare wings strapped to my fuses
In case the hackers snatch the plumage

So you mean these things are worth money
Now drifting off
This is the who-you-calling-homeless
Mock me fearful
Twisted mighty fearful twisted and tonight I got front row seats at the d-d-d-d-dead concert
And you're in it, Ichabod
Running out of morals for my allegory... (moseying)
My kind of people will sell only circles. (woseying)
With my eyes patched in a not so new universe
So I beckon and bray but my pretty bird just ain't muting the many...
Calling Gamma Ray
This is Major Cigar
Do you read me, Gamma Ray?
Gamma Ray, damn it, come in!
Gamma Ray, please respond!
Welp, his brains are fried
Pack it up, mission's over

Do you read me? Do you read me? Do I need to reach through the TV?
Do I need to reach through the ouija? Houston, I may have gone too Houdini
I'm too uneasy, I'm out of phase and I'm orange Tang and I'm powdered eggs
And my radio has been down for days, I just stand around and sound out the phrase
It go, "Do you read me?"
Shook up shoe to beanie
,
y'all look for the moon graffiti
Deep end of some hellhole, come detect this tempo
I been feeding back in these headphones, beating back a profound fear
Farewell to my bread crumbs, is anybody even out there?
I'm like out there, in that true 3D, that new ether, that "Do you read me?"
You don't read me, I'm barely a thing, staring off, I'm too scared to blink
I might shrink some and I shrink more, shrink past this pink dwarf
No sign of my pole star, although up here, it don't mean north
Deep space in no G-force, I more tumble out to some death bell
Some bleep bleep, robot voice, some red lights, some send help
Street meat for some E.T. to come deep fry in old frites grease
And re-home, reach out, reap what he sow
Jesus, do you read me? We don't (We don't)On a sunny afternoon in lower east side New York...
You about ready? (Yeah)
Good morning my sweet vision of morbid disorder
And good evening wonderful riddance and such
Maybe today I'll touch the burgundy halo
Trimming the tunnels end off end with tenants spangled 'cross
A more tangible premise
This splendors, shimmy splinters all up in day-tripper visuals
Take it easy man, fuck it I'll take it any way I can
My palms are chinrests
When I witness fury scurry past my window
Model city in a bottle plugged hostile
Its bliss kissin pollution
And a billion suckers pucker in a bind
Maybe the sunken ship is the treasure
No, but they insist it man, I'm
I'm trying to spin me dizzy, sponging up to giving dungeons functions
As opposed to art historians absorbed inside assumptions
Everybody drop your knuckles when the style divorces vertical
Marveling at the spite with which it curdled
Outside my tenement: coax a little warmth
From out the mugs of masons wasted
Laying bricks for days to later find they own the lot adjacent
Mark the blasphemy, elements of eloquence and savagery
Murder the gossip, fuck it, run off happily
The broken spoke cyclers choking open Doctor Zaius born fetus
In a matchbox keylessly padlocked to the hammer base
Now these impurities embedded in five illiterates textiles
Shedded in the hell tale to motivate behind suspended leverage
Now I'm drowning in a pool of why are you here
Sever ties with my beast of burden pertinent to if I die this year
My name is Dryspell
My name is pillar
My name's allegiance
My name is flagrant
My name's a thousand steps from patience
But I'm sick and tired of waiting
My name's Polaris
My name is canvas
My name is lowlife
My name's intention
My name is every imperfection that plays a part in my descension
My name is carnival
My name is posture
My name is polarized
My name is evidence
My name is delicate approach roped symmetrically to my fellowship
My name's Possessive
My name is cordial
My name is Igloo
My name is captivate
My name is contaminate the rich
And clock the profits for the captive's sake
"Let us hope that the horrors of evil
No longer loiter on the doorsteps of your past"Cameras or guns one of y'all is gonna' shoot me to death
Just know that shit
I take it easy...(x4)

Upside-down I pick wings from beetles
Pry 'em out and pin 'em to the pole over the see-saw
Sofa cobra shimmy out crater
Cradle my weight in double wishbone suspension
Versus AM clock radio bangers
Downside-up in crippled acres
And still the fountainhead spittles sniglets
Quicker than
quidditch seekers snatch golden snitches
You could be a part of it
Just park your bark at 20 paces
Hold this target and we'll call this bitch a partnership
Man! the city bred the brittle cheapo
Little Lego people squeezing little Lego Polaroid in keyhole
Media breather needy burrow to hide all
While you friends and neighbors press stethoscopes to the drywall
Curl a worm tongue tight
, bitten behind the vamp chopper foaming
Lamb choppy sock puppet
fear and loathing
Need phoners a.s.a.p. to build careers out of misquoting
So I read Aesop interviews and get schooled on my own motives
It's a pocketful of nickels
,
like Cool Hand Luke decapitating
Parking meters
when the pigs blew the whistles like windmills
I went to jail overnight for putting a sticker on a phone booth
Now in the time that you did the paperwork
How many'd the rapists merk?
Panicky banister silver surf over the wobbles where the potholes
Be the ulcer in the stomach of the God show
You blinded by the light you might just plummet through the cosmos
Meet Apollo sandman function before the whore hit the high noteBlazin' with a facemelter
Go fish
Pigeon, itching for a pit to put the pig in
Scalped, bottom feeder, nose bleeder,
cheap seats
To the meat eater sweeps sweet freak freaks
What up?
Grip clicker, smack the dummy box fix picture
Stickle over shit, cinema flicker in the plasma
The latch key degree was obtained in the savage years
Where he learned the binding of a wire hanger to rabbit ears
Every pixel that leaked dead over the carpet
Had to be spit shinned and hidden before the ford duster parketh
When mommy marched in, wrapped the broccoli in the napkin
For your electric paradisio after the parent crashes
And I'm high on ion jitters, call it a prime directive of the damned
Who grew to sleep easy to white noise
The humming of the machinery running towards them crawl
Social retardation larvey plugged into the wall
The little short circuit with the still born vibe
Till the villagers circled and determined "it is alive"
Shipped to Bellevue eyes fuzzy talking funny
Like "eagle one to grey squirrel whats your twenty dunny?"
I piss clumsy with electrode head pan (sorry)
Pitty the pretty internet gotta empty the bed pan
Left hand numb from the finger to the thumb (right!)
Right got tubes in it, irony is fun (yaaay!!)
At some point early when drunk on electric kisses
I'd apparently notarized forms excusing scalpel slippage
(sign this)
The pain came on a makeshift main stage
And sentenced to in an inoperable eight bit frame rate
For that I made a game play, reborn torn
At the ministry of information trying to get informed
They'll duck it out and I will cease all wars
So if you babysit a Carroll Ann be fore warned
I be the ultimate (ultimate), multi polar
Mobile medicine cabinet stocked adequate
Pockets like maracas, that will shake when he stepped
Which explains the circle of rattlesnakes where he slept
Smarter then the average bear, barter parts and gadgets
With battery op enthusiast pardon the barking badgers
While you were parking daggers in kittens with snarling children
I was sharking classes with taggers for television (Click!)
Gattaca days, Attica paper scattered
Diagonal mahogany boggled the train savage
To boxed the botanically inclined child slave labor
Blades clipped the perfect petal now play later
Play never, if escaped raped treasure
That's a jewel freebie out a old geezer, no teether
Or even yesteryear scrapes fester, administer gauze
But cauterized wounds bleed if you ain't ethered the cause
King of applause (yay!) beats the garbage flood for ten(?)
Porn king of New York
, alley punk perv scum
Waddle on the voyage of the voyeur
Six four sick king breezer sniff whores through brick
I am so dangerous evil and mercy heaven
Allergy to compassion he is the perfect weapon
Un- earth it and siphoned from Delorean doors swivel up
With aviator radar blip for most glorious titty fuck
Cool green over the frame under the clothes line
Whose crew choose fuel most, mine
Holy trinity, triple six, triple x,
city barrack
Glutton for punishment super size me while you at it
He da:
Built hideous, silk of the milk litigant
Silly wicked finicky fidget the middle digit ish
Will he alter what he feel is illy to pick at every little smidgen of integrity
As your industry bitch? NO
Final answer, track the moniker
To the freight hot reaking of butter beans and harmonica
Dirty old man no tea cup thirst, peak up skirts
For slaps from that d-cup nurse
Cackle his old gums lewd (lewd), crass
Show the girl a trick like how he opens can food with the only tooth he has
She like THAT'S FUCKING DISGUSTING
They don't call him anabolic Aes for nothing, OK
Now current picture aside all anti-celebs remain aggro
Half mast the flag pole
Dead walk sturdy, but the day I greet the worms
I pull the daisies down with me as a fuck you to the norms
Generic's so unappealing and in my humble opinion
Defeats a rappers civic duty to the culture
Granted every topic has been covered but cookie cutter
Delivery of simpleton wit is the real culprit
So whether street, club, battle, conscious or other
I find that interesting style can often out weigh the subject
So when the disc changer goes from guns to space
It is not an attempt to fake credibility for the public
But fuck it it's ace rock six records of gibberish right?
He's trying too hard to be weird and different right? (riiiiight)
Or could it possibly just maybe be, his lessons
Can't be summed up in a linear set of pop culture references?
(WOW) yeah but why try, I'm so groggy
The mach nine Ballentine ain't for everybody
But I will say this to y'all that used your fifteen of fame
To mention my name, that sixteenth minute regret is fucking insane
And that's a longevity veteran peddling free medicine,
(here)
Who the fouler howler (me) who the rabble rouser
What the happy hour starved the Peruvian aggy powder,(tight)
Trade up at the digital Jesus factory outlet (bout it, bout it)
Bout it bout it,
fuck a fork tongue cutlery,
the fuckery is famous
Never wild shook but a slang that maybe alienated a couple strangers
Held
a mongoloid fanbase that is alien by nature
Robot wars, machines hit the floor
And the simians syncopated a gigantic "encore"
Alright I'm bored, five minute bag of tricks
If you hate me you can eat a bag of dicks
ONE
Shooken to Casper
Illustrate beautiful disaster
Flight of the mother ship lift to badger the male-factor
Marionette versus the threat of wire cutter function
Stereotypical Grinch bashing your pumpkin
Plug, try to count up your warrior hatchling batch before gestation segment ended
And head a platoon of embryonic remnants to the game board
Release Japanese beetle swarm to counter the spread of bitch crops
Demolish the harvest and herd colony out immediate
One massive attack, hunted, confronted and gutted
Most pungent component cloned in outrageous bunches
From the grimacing faces to the knots in my shoelaces
I'm a show you all the phases of a fuck up (Yeah)
Plucking the petals but every rose had its thorn
Consider that first warning, second will be good times, laughs and epitaphs
As a matter of basic principle next I set my boat a sail
I won't always be there for your tugging on my coat tails
Family stuck, voyage of the S.S. Martyr
Who you think put that unseen iceberg in the water?
Manufacture flotsam and jetsam from out your charter
We got the once pushovers pushing back a little harder now, blink
I think I can, I think I can
I got grips,
muckraker major spin circles 'round sunken ships
Walk an invisible city of lost clans and he's jealous
Cause my silhouette had more dimensions than his game plans

Fascination, fascination
Fascination, fascination
And everything I do I'm fascinated with
That's why I pass the hated wasteland with a grin, cause in the end I got my passions
While you splash in a puddle of trying to pick apart the puzzle
Fascination, fascination
Fascination, fascination
And everything I do I'm fascinated with
That's why
I pass the jaded grips of competitors who initiate disturbance with a smirk
Cause I feel I got direction in my work

And everything I touch magnificent
Picking apart a drunken township
Sitting in the rain rusting the nails my crown's bound with
If I had an anchor I would lay it in the dirt and mark today
"The Day The Earth Stood Still" while I complete my search
You honor delusions and falsified life comfort systems
As boy in the bubble huddled up to simple Simon subtle
Born tomahawk. Shock the peanut gallery loopy
Debate the cutesy, groupie, Kewpie doll community
And I'm hung in a virtual skin and bones emaciated ringworm
Circus freak bloodthirsty intern trainee urchin feast
With a delectable style compiled of that which stands
To buff a child's yellow brick vision of slick living
I observe the stories from my fire escape observatory
First I herd the glory, then desert the herbs that word it poorly, understood?
Well, maybe a pat on the back for the lucky losers
Who truly felt they were born to touch the music
I catalog cats as welcome mats, and for the ones
Insisting on dimming the stars I wipe my sneakers extra hard
I wish upon a penny toss that every servant will betray his gatekeeper
And
leap to reap the freedom fighter mad galaxy
Huff the war gas vapors and cram hard for tomorrow
Brother, I own twice my weight in patience
Be it padded cubicle or beautiful tomb
I'll be listening 'til
you whistling that more suitable tune
"Checkmate, sucka, not a move, game's over!"

Who's that walking with a hole in his head?
Big bad Bazooka Tooth, I came to break bread
What's a troop's recipe for treacherous times?
I tell 'em... ah, fuck it, yo!

I pull the elephant tranq out of my neck
Gaffle a tank, count up the chips, wrastle the fangs off of my fist
Flood a little soldier blood over the ogre acres
On some holiday in Cambodia with motor-home appraisers
Pagans
fade into the Kodachrome - now, later
With a lid to brow staple
Revisit the cobra loading zone
Molar foaming, but he hold his own wound
Cauterized, by the Zippo he had stole that afternoon
And my dog tags jingle by the monster island heart he built
Grew up with a jughead crown tilt and tardy slip
"Be all you can be" just never soothed us (Nope!)
You lost me in that part about scrubbing piss with a toothbrush
Holler scum's lullaby
Live from the ultra-fly, sham city bunker
Where the coldest cults multiply alarmingly
Hush little baby, timeout!
The black market mockingbirds can not sing a lick
But learn to peck your eyes out
Of commission with love, out a tradition of wraiths
Pick on the visions that buzz,
bet on the kitten's escape
Solder the piston to pump - out a veteran amplifier
And magnify through the same lens that set the ants on fire
Flush the moppet hootenanny
Who could fancy, honor circuit when the circle's every duke is clammy?
Trooper, scoop the food in pantry
Ante up, stupid!
May delusion feed em foofi candy
And pry the gold out of his tooth when lamping
Pocket all you can now
Block' will lead the lambs down
To the cold cutlery outfit, slaughter beef and cow tip
Pour the chief some fountain soda,
motor prone to pen the holy opus
And pry this monkey off the Scoliosis like

Who's that walking with a hole in his head?
Bazooka Tooth, gemini
, I came to break bread
What's a troop's recipe for treacherous times?
I tell 'em fast cars, danger, fire and knives, let's go
Fast cars, danger, fire and knives
Fast cars, danger, fire and knives
Fast cars, danger, fire and knives
I got her majesty Athena riding shotty wide-eyed

It's like never mind the bollocks
Fuck, like every other week these hipster tabloids
Jumping on and off my Sex Pistol's bullets
Like every other week he spins the bottle
Like every other week these fucking fanzines forget if they spit or swallow
Too bad your inner sheep never forgets to follow
Cause my inner greed to feed your hate for loving us is hostile
Fortunate for me, it coincides with what comes natural
So the mongrels that I run with turn the "fuck you's" into fast food
Like a little freak sick of the 3 o'clock bully knuckle dust
Nursing his last shiner, finds the shoebox in his mother's truck (uh-oh)
Tomorrow's extra curricular punching bag
Will finger daddy's widow maker out a brown lunch bag (bang)
This is where the hunch back snake oil peddlers
Stuck under the burgundy sky of spaghetti westerns
Tend to bubble up, weathermen huddle up
Today, the son of one too many "yes sir's"
Kings his checkers, watch the double jump
Back with a platter of hot leeches that'll drink up-every bloody drop down
To the last diseases,
it's A-E-S-O-P-R-O-C-K, the peak twister
Defender of the son of Vaughn Bode's Cheech Wizard
I used to pray the treatments got easier with my aging
Like Serotonin weekends was merely comedic hazing
Wrong, but along his travels located the key to world peace:
Kill every motherfucker but me
You cool with that? Cool, bang
You? Cool, hang
You? No? Uh..bang? Cool
Sorry, dog, rules is rules
And too long have I followed yours
I'm trying to get them years back
And walk through every Cypher with dynamite in a beer hatOnce upon a time
in the days of yore
When the people lived fresh out of legend and folklore
There was an old geezer with a fever to curb
He had a hook, and a line, and a sinker, and a worm
Slept in a city that kissed the seashore
Woke with a bait-and-tackle store trip each morn
Not a bother, not a lot to say
That is until you ask about the one that got a-w-w-w-way
Like a tall tale, keep it rod and reel
With his arms stretched out to define the kill
While the village always listened, believin' him was different
Out of eight million stories there was not a single witness
It was always at the last second when the line snapped
Or the boat broke in half from the size of the catch
Either way the documented proof didn't exist
So the locals dismissed the big f-f-f-fish
Billy-goat beard twenty years in the making
Carry lures in his brim, carry beer in his waders
Stink like alcohol of all prominent flavors
Carry knives in his vest, carry war in his nature
Sat among the forest floor critters and pine cones
And tied a perfect fly with his eyes closed
Veteran angler with a mission to run
Make all naysayers hold t-t-t-tongues
Pale blue moon or fiery orange glow
Red sky at dawn or rain, hail, sleet, snow
Black storm cloud with the barometric horrors
The weatherproof sportsman spins yarns regardless
Laugh if you wanna, but the dude ain't stupid
Let it roll off his back like drizzle off plumage
Cause he woke with a twinkle in his eye
Like "Every dog has his day and today is m-m-m-mine"
Take-take the medicine, tastes great
Got the key to the city, I'm wake-baked
Way before the media shitting or 12 zip of ganked paint
The origin of a thievery leader will take place
Two coke bottles adorn the rogue toddler
Grapple a refrigerator, gaffle a Nilla Wafer
And no role model provoke him to shift focus
Cause he noticed that a cookie tastes better when it's stolen
Kids got the darnedest quirks
So 11's arms skip jars for his momma's purse
And bought enough fireworks from the bullies to blow up a small barn
Which he kept in a box in the yard
And the bark isn't carved from
a klepto-anthem
But a klepto-tangent prefaced the grand canvas
Dance to the dirge, stand up
Celebrate the natural need to own what ain't earned
See it rolls off the tongue
Like a smoke ring
rolls off a lung 'til it's done
Ready, set, kept petty theft on a post-it
Later apply the motives to a moment on some grown shit
"Hey, you with the sharpie and BM!"
Did you foreplay the GM,
or you
carpe the diem
?
Whore play the porn game, fornicate the sure way to freedom
Or correlate with the swordplay and heathens?
Trickery and backtalk, fresh outta high school
On the prickly catwalk of the modern grind slide rule
Every last number in its history
Got is own little hustle to nuzzle up with the victory
Thanks, bathe in a bottle of your finest
Tackleberry sift through the piss looking for diamonds
Before the hell appears to put the chemi in the climate
Get your money from the richest, get your pussy from the flyest
Slow and low, do or die calm,
suicide king in the tuck of the palm
Slow and low, do or die stuck,
two to five cans in the tuck of the trunk
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you...
(Capture the flag)
(Capture the flag)
(Capture the flag)
One by one like little confused penguins
Larceny's yes-men
ooze for used weapons
Like a bitter little burglar jaded up out the bucket seat
Is dumb enough to feel like the public owe him a fucking thing
Nope, gotta configure the five finger
So the hot-wired vehicular skill is applicable
If an eye's on the prize and the itch ain't flushed
I hope the fruits of your labor outlive the initial rush, like
Step on the abysmal cusp
With matchmakers trying to make the mixed signals fuck
Then incubate the mutt baby through his stigma's crutch
Like he will learn to walk after he lifts the drums
And this is certified milk by the New York Department of Skullduggery
Shoplift quicker than your shutter speed, click!
Missed, he dipped with dumb cutlery
In and out of muddy river water 'til the rudder bleed
Skip around the money pillar
, color me bunny killer
Hovering where the mother feed, gutter greed king
And a crummy motherfucker breed fuck with me
It go knock knock rummy at a bruckner speed
The seed's all growns up playing grown people games
Evil aims grown, encompass the whole steeple chase
Grip, mitigate the master plan
So when the workers are asleep, riffraff expands
Yes a pig is a cop, but gotta fill up the flock
So when I rake in the bacon I hope the kiddies'll watch
I hope the flipping of the system will be heavily clocked
Cause opportunity's fickle, after it trickle it stop
Capture the flag,
drag that crass little bastard
Flat through the hazmat and glass
Laugh when he ask for it back; scratch that:
Welcome to the magic in a basket of cashHouse of cards and bent bars, hold up
Body parts that jump out that jar, hold up
The coven make a circle in the yard, hold up
It starts with a gambit from beyond
And a mile-long list of people I plan to haunt, hold up
Old heresy, headed for disembodiment
As rendered by an excerpt from the Lesser Key of Solomon, um
Evil see him as a vehicle to commandeer
2 fixed pupils, all he say is "Ian's not here"
Pitch it down a octave, I'm a take this opportunity
To piss and vomit lava while the neck is lazy susan-ing
True abomination at the beckon of the nether
From the scales to the fin to the fur to the feather
I'm all of Animalia stitched together by a severed hand
Freed into the cold and told to bring us home a head in sand
Hit the brick In a ceremonial bone mask
Viper on his fingers speaking Latin, don't ask
Crossroads bogey, I broker the deal first
I bag up a soul quick, I drag it between worlds, hold up
Only ever had a last nerve, hold up
Spirit box talking out of turn, hold up
Everyone's a player at the purge, hold up
1, 2, undo a divine act
They don't like it when I waltz in and turn wine back, hold up
Flying rats in a V over demon country
Organizing, but you probably draw the line at Easter Bunny
I'm beleaguered by the end if awake at the autopsy
In a state of grace, radiating sacred geometry
And oration, I'd recommend a cooler for the conjuring
Comfy shoes, and not to be a nuisance to the honoree
He's probably got a hundred ways to gork y'all
Doesn't need a chaperone to show him to the short straw
Orchestrate impious in compliance with the harvest moon
Crosses tend to somersault, bibles fly across the room
Audience are volunteered and sawed in two to fetch a laugh
I'm sorry for the awkward news, it doesn't have a second half Superstition making room for true perdition
If you think it's too elusive we can book a future visit, hold up
Fog at the foot of the expanse, hold up
Phantasmagoria wanna dance, hold up
Handful of crickets in the pan, hold up
Through the valley with a howl and a hiss
Every step is like a house on a witch
Any Judas into sappin' how I'm zappin' get the trowel and brick
I'm all thought-crime, cowlick and fizz
You could pull up to whatever close encounter you want
Catch him with a dozen flowers
or an owl and wand
Pick a path, firebrand, miss him with the hooey
Beleaguer a baddie and add 'em to ratatouille, ooey
I still chief L's on a rooftop
You still need help with your juice box
I'm trouble, you troubleshoot a lot
Cue his blue blockers maneuvering through the future shock
Where fam from a different phase of the crawl
Get to step up and fail to communicate through a wall
Maybe it's less about escape and more a favor to y'all
After waking up with geometry engraved in his palm,
either way

We are not the same, heaven is a lie
I think you a lame, lemme get a fry
We are in the weeds, begging for a sign
I think you a leech, lemme get a fry

I avoid sunlight, Chuckie, and
buckets without fuzzy dice
Money pits, and sucker shit, and
run-ins with the blood of Christ
Unabashed do-nothings who do nothing but multiply
And multiply, or any hooded reaper out to thumb-a-ride
Desert cottontail hanging from his talons
I been hanging with my demons
Future hanging in the balance
Plan a caper on a napkin
Trading slang into the evening
Drive a tank around Manhattan
What a world, what a world
Broken, bloody, undeterred
Local weather rumbling on some mother earth with stomach worms
Current mood bluer than a gummy shark
I should probably learn to move around the color bar
I should probably wear some jewelry made of human bone
It adds a visual component to my "you should go"
Thought bubble generally jam-packed, with dollar sign, exclamation point, ampersand, hash
The rope goes over the wall
For the controller born to hold a stethoscope to a vault
Wooly willy, peel off in a barrel over the falls
And down river by the time they radio for the dogs
I crossed heart, can't tell a bad day from a death wish
Detour through the graveyard with a
chef's kiss
They don't make a pill for that, it's too advanced
All you can do is lick your wounds and whistle past the boogie mans
Wicked forces in the wings descending on the simple things
Like taffy at the boardwalk under ribbons of flamingo pink
Which mutates into overcrowded Plinko on a laser grid
Havens turn dangerous, friendly faces, traitorous, ayy
I'm never late, I'm never early ever, right when I'm meant to
To counteract the evil that men do
I'm a motherfuckin' gem in the refuse
Even when the world's ending, what the F is your excuse?
Don't get brave around the cave mouth
Get chased, ain't no lollipop on the way out
I'm way out, the way of the walk is a different discipline
It's difficult,
ten thousand hours get you to guinea pig
Dirtbag daddy,
snatch a lackey off a chessboard
Hack up any edgelord, plastic wrap death's door
Ten-four, half-wit, I ain't your good buddy
I can, however, be bought with a blue slushie

Good goddamn, good goddamn
Every idol I ever met is a conman
Good God, good God, good goddamn
Gotta hopscotch hot pan to hot pan
Good God
Good God
Good God

I grew up over seven plies of maple wood that chew up new terrain
You laughing because I'm different, I'm laughing 'cause you the same
I been discovering a distant corner of the human brain
Whose function is to see you rue the day that you rebuke the name
Don't do it,
social cues bouncing off his open wounds
Folk are on some, "Oh, hello," I'm on some hocus pocus, poof
Holy moly, motion blur from bloke to Canis Lupus
By the fifth frame of the photo booth
Show that to your focus group
You can not domesticate the modern vigilante
Who increasingly identifies as energy expanding
My pat on the back is a little Edward Scissorshands-y
Come and send it with the cleverest to never stick the landing
Tomb raider, screwface under the gauze
Y'all should giddy up or get your city covered in salt, yeah
I am dumb enough to run through a wall
Build another one and run through it too, what is he on?
Electric green smoothies and bean water from Vietnam
Orchids in the air and
over forty years of beat the clock
We will not be keeping calm
We will turn barbarians to Carrie at the senior prom
Meet us in the creeping fog
I know you weebles wobble, but never completely topple
Even more reason for me to see you obscenely remodeled
Let's get your body walloped into Braque or P. Picasso
You ain't the person you let your believers think they follow
We'll have more news after this commercial word
(And so it goes..)
At least I think I was here asleep
Is it possible? Conceivable?
That I sleepwalked out of my apartment and went berserk?

In slid rhythm, fed a cycle bound by dilemma, debt, and vendetta
Escaped briefly back to my apartment to park in front a fan
And reminisce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my hand
Contestants get the New York home game with real life shoot 'em up-action
Thug, vagrant, yuppie and art freak game piece all included
I told this cat the Earth was flat, he walked 'till his beard grew
Long enough to strangle himself for being stupid
It's bric-a-brac novelties, spliced with that sixth pack odyssey
Godspeed, tequila worm future, be concerned
My feelers spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings
While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings
I'm a never give, I'm juiced off projection
I'm stubborn as a thousand born-agains avoiding questions
From the alpha to the zed, I bait this data for my pledge
To bathe a traitor of the twice forgotten favors that he bled
And not a creature stirred
It reeks of subway metal, bevel edged journalist chin-on-fist shenanigans
Re-coin mayhem with bonuses, benefits and break room
Mummified mannequins with future clenched adamant
And skeleton in cabinet
This amalgam circus got a ring of fire
Just big enough to shove my purpose in the circle
I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew
Release the hounds
To see which one could track your trail and serve you, sucker
I lay the law down upon its belly while my foot
Dug in between the 3rd and 4th disc yelling "Break yo' self!"
I finally actualized data commission
Past penny tip jar donation arrangement, but a far fetch from stability
Took a hard pledge early on
Blood donor to drum dozer, plowing the metronome, home
Blown caddy-cornered to cockeyed sound booster
Sensationally seismograph
Stabbing away on stone tablet to sketch a grouchy future
I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down
Sample of cancelled development, courtesy America
Land of the freebase
, home of the triplicate grill character
My sorta sideways tilt caught pinball blinker and citizens 1-X
Weren't steadied for this leaning grievance with dilapidated winter jacket
I rock a crooked lid piece and sweat a bit to make my wookie ends meet
Pacifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed
Wing clipper out hierarchy
Passionate while they whine on some "Daddy's gonna kill Ralphie" shit
Suck the proverbial silver spoon 'till their parents quit apparently
Parasol spinning casually like
"I'm an artist, please don't laugh at me"
OK, time to buckle the fuck down
Solder your wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin
You could catch the memoir in several dimensions
The joy-of-life logic don't employ the spite process
Hence your plight botches

No
I don't know what got into me
I didn't mean to cause all that destruction
I'm sorry
So sorry

This be the, this be the big
F-L-A-S-H-F-L-O-O-D, flashflood
This be the big
F-L-A-S-H-F-L-O-O-D, flashflood

Possible, conceivable
That I sleepwalked out of my apartment and went berserk
Flies buzz around the sink
Lunch on crumbs, fuck y'all think
Everything was fine, not a single peep
It happened overnight, must've been the açaí
Some uninvited guests, some unappealing sludge
A couple hundred eggs, a day to yield bugs
I make a few traps, bleach in the drain
You should see the trash, it feels like a plague
Clean the whole crib, bottles at the curb
Even empty out the fridge, that's gotta be a first
Still can't win, two on the tiles
Three by the spout, me in denial
I'm clapping at the air, I'm cornered by the plates
I'm brought unto my knees, I'm forfeiting the space
I'm clawing at the walls, swarm ordering me ate
It's death from above, nobody saying grace
This fallen angel could stitch a wing with a shoestring;
The prime directive selects reflective aviation bathed in mood swing
I'm broke.
I know a walking corpse who'd spit icicle dagger to slit throat
Quicker than you can prove there's four letters in hope
(H-O-P-E)
I paint a portrait from my cell called life
inside the tortoise shell
Tortured
Orbiting hell's orchard intrigued but not compelled
I smell a hint of charred child flesh sweeping through my quarters
Order one canteen of liquid caffeine and eclipse the slaughter
Now is you is the villain of my kabuki hologram
Cuz I hobble with hollow hands
Please pan the nozzle
We see intent to re-invent dream application with homage to ancients
But honor modern replacements circling now basics
I'm Bilbo Baggins with stilts tipping the Petri dish (fresh)
Beached fish on the shores where the feast of wits eat the corpse
Divvy the servings and study the traits that deemed killer breed credible
That's a harp of a different color but the song remains identical
I am not a crook
I cook the wick at both ends
Just to blend that element of chance with my tight rope dance
Life
Sight beyond
Fire ant with a hunger pain gut be gone
Belong to something civil, saint, cuz this Rembrandt paints on
And it's a cold canvas lodged in the gut of Atlantis
Some present impressive lung, some truly learn what a death chant is
I alone personify mankind's collective sulk
As a result of one angry Zeus fist blistering cult pulp in bulk
Face it
Die
Place it on the shelf next to the portrait mommy gave you of the day it rained
But y'all posed by the slave ship anyway
Make it rain 'til the levy breaks
My fetus breeds as a combine of father time and his sweetest concubine, wine
And it saddens me like televised casualties
I'll be hung in the village square in exactly 5 minutes;
You don't want to miss it
As a token of my discontent regarding the equation
I'm officially closed for consultation

I float; while everyone around me's busy drowning...
I float; while everyone around me's busy drowning...
I float; while everyone around me's busy drowning...
I float"Fuck me!"

Two shoes chewed up, colluded with the feuds, rogue, veterans
Food, clothes, medicine
Wheeled it out the smoke stack factory trained to capture in the zoo's ghost predators
Food, clothes, medicine
I think I thunk a bunk colony could possibly amuse grown delegates
Food, clothes, medicine
Peace, the whipper-snapper generation greet 'em with a full blown pistol pull
Food, clothes, medicinal
Variety, for every plastic orange bottle
The tarnished pharmacy labels chafed in abrasive pockets
Suit the hell hounds with blades and chain lengths
For the dead walk a little less clumsy than you think
Hunger pain, chump change tell it to how his belly get
When bourgie hopes hellions
Food, clothes, medicine,
alumni
Bum, I got the skin on the teeth between my fingertips and stellar
Let's bet it melts together
Let's get these men some shelter
Three hots and a cot with Quaaludes
On a pillowcase left on an ultimately cordial gesture by the staff, (Staff)
It's a bath house for brave soldiers
When they coordinate to fornicating whores in maid's clothing
Sip a hot mocha, kick-up-chug up to the apple box
Frankie says, "Relax", 20 says he snaps, safe wager
Hell, 90 percent sensitive jubilee
Never returned to brag about that fish bigger than you and me
Walk on glass, cruise cloaked residents
Bang on doors, food, clothes, medicine
United we stand to all our parties click
I divide and conquer cause frankly I'd rather sit
We saw them rat races, machine or man, sprocket or fat laces
Hatchback of flashbacks from a heyday full of bad blazers
Now Major Aes route the following order
To all his crew's chromed generals
Food, clothes, medicine

Walk on glass, bang on doors
Talk all trash, hang on whores
Walk on cash, bank on wars
Like food, clothes, medicine, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours

We rotate protocol on a ring finger neighbor to peruse gross negligence
Food, clothes, medicine
Martyrs leak faster if the carver tweaks the dagger
,
90 moves choked citizens
Food, clothes, medicine
Well y'at's a quick example accept as commitment's castle, cool, dope, excellent
Food, clothes, medicine
It's tough to legislate when scum tongue down a dinner plate of booze, coke, heroin
...
I'll bite the hand that feeds
Chew the steak and spit the knuckles back
Stitch 'em up and give em dap, before his brother's rubberneck
Iron chef Lithuania christen kitchen stadium
With chicken and mass serotonin drifting into gravy-dom
Save me some,
scallywags hold your breath
The curmudgeon's gun dusty like the road to death
Bag a pin stripe my lizard kisser no kill switch
Just a guilty gizzard wanna recommend a pill slip
I wipe placenta off my face in the height of the disco era
Cruise through liquid bubble gum, fever, death, and Christmas sweaters
Through juice saccharin fast food studied holdin' cliff's notes vendors
Now holds a bachelors in training ninjas to tip toe better
These are them sham city kidney kicks to the loose bolts
Belly ache-killins for claim who stand iffy on food, clothes, medicate
Pollywog, hug a spot lit with bigger lizards
In the land of hot milk and honey with stingers in it
Zinger!
Jimmy to jist up, check ya tip cup
Mother's watching babies near to preachers keen on fist fucks
Keep your schnoz clean, ears open, chopper zipped up!
Food, clothes, medicine, cause hungry, naked, sick, sucks!
Collide your worker ants, with autobahn inertia dance
And curb them herbie love bug by the cursive final curtain clamp
Another savior with his foot, cold, stuck in his mouth
I played that who knows, food, clothes, fuck it, I'm out

Before shooting troops was cooler than hula hoops
High noon was your basic who's who of brutal truth
Hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance
Turn a young'n to a dozen paper dolls holding hands
And tricky was a wooden horse pushed up on your porch
So chicanery was yours to engage or ignore
I was on the ladder with a lotta dot pawns
So we carried lawn chairs and buckets of popcorn
Pass the popcorn
Brawl fair, cop car
Voyeur hawk him out his hinges, storm door splinters
Clamoring about, hammers out about to ring
Infiltrate each others tribes and murder each others queens
Packed to the very last rafter
Clung to the rafts and the Cameras to capture the damage
Neck swivel with a chop-chop volley
Where the ants leave nothing but the bones and the car keys
Pardon if his Ttwo feet fester
It was rude of me people
Meet left and lefter
Planted like a model of civility and honor for the sector
But never got his extra extra!
Peace for the better but it wasn't entertaining
So they waited for the tazing from the safety of his haven
Like bees to the honey when they lumped you up
Cuz bumper cars are only funny when they bump. know that
Hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance
Popcorn, pocorn
Hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance
Capture the damage, capture the damage
Capture the damage, capture the damage
Popcorn, pocorn
Tune to hellemundo for action packed blasphemy
Big city translate your face 'til it atrophy...
I let the shadenfreude boy out, actually
Deployed devoid, with grin to watch laughingly
(yeah bitch)
Pass the p's it's a laugh in, I can smell the tragedy
When hatchin'
Happily dispassionately patched in, alive with the menace of demise
Like "yes!" the pain dazzles...
Man
Pass the popcorn, pass the popcorn
It's reality at its fastest
And yet it still unravels at a pace like molasses
Like it's the last of the seconds
Before the worst of disasters stretch past us
Wouldn't you agree that it is fabulous?
In the corridors of entropous wars contort drastically
Til it fits, I adjust to climates or the wilderness
Walk along my spine take the pilgrimage
Up into the section that's reserved for the smirk of the coldest witnesses
Work you motherfuckers
Hooray!
There's all day to die
Innovate the mayhem with grace, the good form-fall
Fuck if I'm 'a warn y'all, now I got the front row to the greatest entertainment that an angel never saw
Sixty thousand watts of that raw
"pull the claw out of the trunk" fun
Each one teach one how to club one
Look at how they bathe up in that dove blood
It's gonna be a night of thrills and chills where the sacred is made of
Mud mudIt goes welcome the pop off, some pop soft. We bang b-bang b-bang bang out loud. Ready on the left with a face full of death. We slanged out fang mouth bang out now

This is a never dug disco. Spread feelers. Tonka zonk Gepetto bred beezers. Jeepers, gee wilikers, goshes galoshes, Christ, god almighty. They tore his limbs off kilter, still the hostage moshes slightly. Hung off the balcony by the skin off his doctor's psyche. He hopes it holds but knows the locusts kamikaze nightly. He woke, corroded buggy facial, insect chopper biting. He's only bones by the time the ungodly body's sighted. He saw the puddle, full color hideous monster Viking. He used to survey if the vermin dined on others like him. He found the fucks indigenous to him and awfully feisty. He grew old awkward grinch and settled into bonkers nicely. I alert vital spider works to cultivate grit, ship the bulk rate shit. Herbie the love bug drugs pulsate whips. Tie in spite for commoner idiocy and good old-fashioned biblical plague.

Your flimsy frame marks hip-hop's second most tragic event and will 'til Jam Master Jay's resurrection and second death

Without a trace

Like try to shoot the star out of his face

Spoon up the ballooning for high noon saloony antics
Walk off with a thumbs up
And a stuffed Bullwinkle trinket
Pull twinkle out them awestruck baby sockets for a day
Yeah that's the ticket
Yeah that's the pipe dream
That's hater 101 bitch pigs

That's Keebler signs Pikachu
And he's poking pinocchi-beezer

Knobby-kneed geezer

He couldn't

That's why these grapevines could pop shit to me all day
I only kick these fucking doors down to make sure the crew o.k
Like, food on the plate
Thread on the back
Kicks on the palette
I rock the bells without clown shoes, fried dough, tickets or mallets
While the bearded ladies won goldfish from the ping-pong toss challenge
Threw like girls and misconstrued the lucky fuck floaters for talent
It's sad really...
O.k., I'm over it
Smolder over composure models like smoke over soldier nostrils
3d bifocal goggle broke over cat walkers
There must've been something up in that Long Island tap water
Grew to mute Grinch north of Who-ville and his frisky sissy poodle pack
Oozing that hollow 'who the mac?' act Aes threw back in junior rap
Isn't it strange how it's a fad to bite your idols
When the whole reason you liked 'em was cuz their shit wasn't recycled?
Come pigeonhole Aesop like he ain't heard it
That's no burden
Need attention?
Better dress them diversions like stripping nurses
Kid the cult is thick and media's the sacrificial virgin
Purging little man behind curtain opinions
This is perfect
Look I'm just like y'all
Living low-pro to paycheck
And when the landlord hollers he hid the 'dro in the tape deck
Rocket radio
Every success smidgen he harnessed
Parks with risk and sick with it clicking in perfect working ratio
No frisky out of dodge name blame for sneaky plots
With elevated rung placement derived from deep-rooted jealousy issues
He cue the raging bull and every due is paid in full
With that I forget all you motherfucks that failed to pull
Why? Well
What's really good?
Not a cat who peddles backwards for a hacker's filthy looks
Hodge-podge menamena-Muppets available in rubber stamp form
Hogwash Harry clamp norm
Wear the space cake baker?
Order up
Curb his pacemaker
And vacate personal space in relation to face-raker
Built an Einstein-Rosen bridge to '88 with Lincoln Logs and bobby pins
Probably when Oz's friends slept on the poppy stems
Horseback 60 M.P.H
One hand rolling tobaccy badly
But it burns out cavalry of concerned worms for mayor
But you'll find validity in a penny, right
And I got a clear flick of the Loch Ness sucking off YetiPractice at the same time keep your bottom reads as close as you can I read from here driver side of your neck back try to think about a straight line from the very bottom of your tailbone all the way up through the crown of your head take a deep breath in and a deep breath iron express in Reached arms out in up touch your palms above your head maybe look up between your palms stretch back into T and then X killed I am forward fold relax all the way down bend your knees  goji vita as much as you need to get all your fingertips on the ground so for some argue that might be really bent and then other people can maybe straighten their legs a little bit more make sure your head is relaxed so that your spine is completely relaxed send your breast into the very base and your children to the very base in your spine keep a little soft

Let me put you up on Bob's donuts
Controller of the warm deep fryer that charms cobras
Mostly it was aggravated ulcers over goat's legs
Will they go for maple, custard, buttermilk or wolfs bane?
Hm
,
late after your cinderella pulsate
and crash I was rotating casts
Picture if you will a witching hour on a week night in the trenches
Where paranoia dead-ends in a bright florescent heaven
With sprinkles, I know right yum
Whether tummy ache or fever
Keep the funnel cake
I'm honey glaze in vitro
In the company of similar believers
Sleepless, who hear the walls breathe and foam at the facial features
Now the yeast, a phoenix in the partially hydrogenated
Equal parts flour, faith, healing
Might replace your previously nominated Jesus
But only if you privy to the following secret of all secrets

Shh, every night at 12 they would march out from the back
With a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat
Show up around 1 never get your God back
If you're just tuning in, walk into the light
Walk into the light

I boil oil too, not for scarfing
For CCs of Japanese innovation that screech into free parking
Purple heart and second chin that beseech him to squeeze the carbs into the motherboard
You can chew the Eucharist in cruller form
Locally a seedy danish underworld is bustling
Where jelly's not a celebrated stuffing, it's a puppet string
Pluck, nose for canola
5 cow stomachs like a mime with a rope going nowhere
Fast, right hand of god on my shoulder, crows feet swollen, dopey
Combing apple fritters over with folk of opposing cultures
Baby sitter cop thief reverend, body glitter, botched c-section, bronze teeth
Each progressively more sequestered
Yet if threatened will defend the raisin bread as codefendants
Some lose religion or view it as superstition
You can tell a friend if you are down to kill them

Shh, every night at 12 they would march out from the back
With a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat
Show up around 1 never get your God back
If you're just tuning in, walk into the light
Walk into the light
"You ain't shit man, your story's a joke
You should package it with a last smoke and six feet of rope."

Stay awake little misfit
Her lips wet a very particular mischief
Sis' wiggle an index, if your limbs let
Or settle for a warm, burgundy bubble out of her beak instead

Hey, tequila to free the worm
Had his liver scuba suit up on the Sabbath
His personal pale rabbit
At the hole's end
her delicate mitten tipped
For sticking pissy liquor in him every day at six
Silly, predictability is a bitch
Fully patterned, had her awkwardly christening the small talk chalk board
She said, "This is less of a fixer-upper than my last bar."
"Funny, you're less of a fixer-upper than my last whore."
Crass is Similac to the milky wit of today's youths
Both chuckle out
Next couple on the house
Next couple on the couch
Swapping social coma rants
Phobias and soldier doubts, jokes and corporate mogul bans
Motor-mouths
The key to open his closure:
Pussy plus yay; she hid in a broken toaster
And later wake neighbors over chemical flavor to fuck sickly
Tooth, nail beauty through the skin deep

An object at rest tends to remain at rest
And an object in motion tends to remain in motion
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
And in the same direction
Down... down... down...

Now the dizziness is similar to whimsy with a pretty twist
If pretty is a bidding war for meteors of iffy sniff
And cigarettes, and pills on a speaker
Silhouetted by the muted television and the rickety Venetians
Between tweaks, he sweeps at home depot and reads
Mostly biblical, but not cause he believed
But found the lexicon of Jesus-heavy literature fly
Feverishly sponged up the information high
Fade into the cradle of his same deck train wreck
She pet him with a mechanical tape deck play back
Plus, the depressing sum of the two combined pay checks
Stung less when little Debbie D-cup put her legs back
Drunk, put her on the business-end of his favorite couplet from
Corinthians
Sunk into the comforts of a kid again
Enough to share the stuff that truly interest him
This is where the vision of a shiny, happy Christmas end
Tipsy little princess wasn't listening, just yes-ing him
The more she fed him "yes", the more he fed her fresh barbiturates
Assuming it was them against the world into oblivion
But he was just a stupid simian that her live with him
The ritual goes, same window, different visual
Wing of wax? Or wing of gold leaf? Choose one
Float or plummet 20,000 cold leagues
My nourishment's provided in the summer
So then I wonder how y'all chasing dreams when what's tangible still outruns you!
Hail dirty doll immaculate performance
Warm as the march of a billion torches forward to burn what I'm born in
Cut and paste alertness to current settings provided quick
Shimmy the pirate ship mass, spot the island, sound the siren
And about face
Let's salute the embraced pertinent generals
Who turned innocent hermits to burning spectacles
Flirtin' with a serpent working overtime
, drain the battery
Siphon the poison to flood his majesty's hatchery
I was riding on a yellow bus to where the brush thickens
And it ain't exactly plush pickings
I'd rather take the time to burn every last bridge
I've ever crossed
beneath the sun
Than live my life knowing you may one day follow me over one
Snake bite, breath too heavy to hold
Caught up in the wake of the red witch trying to swim it
Ran for the sake of dead cliques stripped of idyllic image
Steal a sloppy earth meal
Feed my pottery wheel to model colossal vision
Thrill, trucking with a bucket of pennies
I'm 'a drag my sneakers through the dirt like alligator bellies 'til the cloud burst
Honor and a loud thirst submersed in a trap
Little drummer boy vs. thunderclap
 x2
In a city of garbage, trying to reap the harvest
Adaption is the trap in which the artist meets the forest
Swing your little ax or be an oak tree if you can't
Either way; adapt to circumstance or play your final hand
You don't know enigma
An attempt to bury the hatchet rendered me victim of deviltry
Plus wounded like stigmatics
Something's huffing hazardous
I smell an inch of difference in this morning's pollution pistons
And how the loose ends drifted
My sour patch institution slipped in amidst the invaders and pardon my tone
But this garden's grown fucking acres since my visit
Itching to count the layers in the blizzard
'Til that chapter where my family inserts the dagger and twists it
It's a carnival
Have you any sweets for my weary kin? It's a carnival
Have you any feed for my cheery grin? It's a carnival
Welcome, play our games, you'll never win
'Cuz it's that carnival where every freak show spectacle's your friend
And I'm a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas
Anti-freeze to glacier,
cookin' a look of fiery nature
It's the ceiling feeling too heavy to bliss the I-beams for a fraction more
Collapsed and left 'I'm sorry' tacked to you door
Pitching my back to hell's kitchen
Back burner murder machinery released regardless of the pardons
Hitching my life to the leash of one minstrel
Sick of same window different visual
Same agnostic hostage different ritual
Plague, cooperative super colony clash
I heard you got a dust collection, lemme see it
I duel as underdog vs. forced adaptation to the marvels of the now
Since then, my knuckles haven't once dragged on the ground
Some of you know me already
Those of you who don't, you're in for a great big fucking surprise
For those of you who do can expect an infinitely more horrible time than they care to remember

I drag in the cat that drag in the conversation piece
Yahweh-forsaken elite
,
hemlock in the pot every day of the week
, I'm a lot
Reach in, even the odds or evolve into mystery meat for the broth, who's eatin'?
Scream for his mom all evening, moxie a seasonal fog
Palmful of grease, skied through "Keep Out" signage
Weed in his sock, beacon of snot
Knee-deep evil to plot through a fever, maid threw his Rod of Asclepius out
Spring and bell exploding through my Polartec
Got a soul and vessel, don't coalesce
Got a nosy compulsion to overstep
I write 8-bit maps for the so depressed
From the croc in the moat to the gold in the chest
Notice I don't program any actual way to progress
To convey an effect
Hot Vinyasa to bated breath
That fray, that plague, that bayonet
That hate, that face of death
That all-in together, I'm afraid that train has left
I ain't wade through bullshit or baby step
Pop off into flesh, no beta test
I bump
Raising Hell
, I make raisin bread
Raised on wolf's milk and
Eraserhead
I'm all good
Quietly hacking away at a hideous riff on the formula
What is the work if it isn't a ticket to slip into vivid euphoria?
Huh?
(You know we're being watched)
(You know we're being watched)

I brought gauze
Two kind of knives
Carrots for the horse
Tie his own flies
If you're coming, bring soap
Something for the cough
A million feet of rope
Maybe more gauze

(One, two three four)
Ayy, grey beard, wayward
Parade wave and vacate the framework
Phased out, trade for blank tapes and bait worms, eek
Ease in the weeds, no safe word, K?
No kayfabe, all true tales from the pay grade
Heavy on malaise and away games
The tiptoe tailed by a trail of craters
I am way too Canis Major, et tus?
Let me guess, you tout the brave few
Then make Jesus take the wheel by day two
I don't really pander or plan to behave
If the police sketches a hand from the grave, unholy
Don't luminol the upholstery
His poor old Nonna would roll on her rosary, I know
I go from a homie to bogey and ghost
I'm sorry if you know me as both
I still float hearts from the haystack
I give free hugs in a plague mask
I don't trust none of y'all's love to be more than a cheap toy gun with a bang flag
Ayy, sultan of simple fare
No lie, roll by, we can lick the air
It's an appeasement gesture, not a rib tip rare
But the bistro don't split silver hairs
I made peace with a lot, but a lot of it sits
Still, genuine props on the bottomless pit
Backseat drive with a lazy drawl
I don't aim to please, I don't aim at all, I'm okay
Actively seeking to underdevelop his sentimentality
Why am I here if it isn't effectively cutting the hellions out of me, huh?
(You know we're being watched)
(You know we're being watched)
I see how y'all be trying to front, man
Y'all be fronting, man

Been a bit since Mu died
Been a lot more loss in the wake
I recall thinking, "Someday, someone's gonna say it's all from the same cause and effect"
And I just couldn't fathom blaming a whole new page on a made-up chain reaction
Each claim individual peaks and pockets
Pains and a slew of unique nuances
Nah mean? When you wake up eight years non-responsive
It's a lot to process
Gone from a happier jack-in-the-box
To a package of clogged up chakras
Oh, shazbat!
Not the "ever after" he wanted
From the "Once upon a time, dot, dot, dot"
Once upon a time, he was so much more
Than a punchline for his own potshots, ah
Watch the Impossible Kid
Everything that he touch turns promptly to shit
If I zoom on out, I can finally admit
It's all been a blur since Mu got sick
None of the subsequent years stood a chance
Whether you his moms or his mans
Whether you his pops or his girl, I was poison
Heart full of canines, head full of voices
Whole life trying to quiet 'em down
Like a suicide king with a knife in his crown
Hounds at bay, but they just won't stay
True friendship in a tugboat way
Ae go dark in the face of the fucked
When the fucked was a friend, that was basically done
Into the woods go his alien tongue
It was that or a textbook faking of funk, and I can't
Here go the hindsight:
Eight years been one long blindside
I could pinpoint seven more turns that occurred 'cause he never really healed from the first
Oh, what a world, any hack is a myth
Any dap is a joke, any map is a trick
Any graph is a hoax, ease on down
I'm burning up, I'm bleeding out
Knowing ain't half the battle
That's a bullshit quip written by some asshole
You can own what you are and still sit around stoned in your car
Not doing shit, halfway to nil
Cranky and waiting for a boss key and hat full of bills
Get out the car, Aes
Ayo, ayo, I send this to all of my corporate corpses
Tryna abort the thoughts of comin' out wildin'
Dumbin' out time to off the office
I was surely sorta twisted
Worked at a TV studio, an audio assistant
Easy, do my duty, though at times was in a mean mood
Hot, I gotta be cool
I was on the brink of fiend's drool
Glaring at the green room
Made a brother the same color
,
but beyond neon
Pushin' me to peon, barkin' at dreams to be gone
Tending to the talent and many, they haven't any
Was especially a challenge when he be like
Goddamnit, can he hear his vocal?
As he cuffin' it, "How my mic sound?"
Thinkin', on the low, it's perfect when he put the mic down
Clown stand steady grillin', wanting subservience
Sound man buryin', thinkin' I'd fuckin' murder them
And steamin' as I'm watchin' duke
Leavin' on some hot pursuit
Gotta win, as these cats be modelin' what not to do

In a (Getaway car, geta-getaway car)
In a (Getaway car, car-car-car-car)
In a (Getaway car, geta-getaway car)
In a (Getaway car, car-car-car-car-car)
Six in the morning and the walls close in
High noon calls and the walls own him
Kings at the ready know the walls won't win

Storms on the harbor like a harbinger of gore
(Right)
Gore is my harbinger,
pardon The Art of War
(Right)
Get your doors darkened
By the house of card carpenters
Who never thought a slave could be a Spartacus and more
Pencil sharpener with a resume for the carnivores
Who take important conference calls in corner office walls
Still, a buck is a buck and he punch numbers
Five - punch
Just say no to company functions
And he duck into the dungeons
Nothing says "Kill it" like a day of fetching
Paper clips and staplers for the privileged
Two lives, one is chores for whores
One is where I wanna be when you begin regretting yours
And I poured in with a large coffee
Tardy every morning
To a man who took authority beyond what it was for
How you gonna pay the rent day-job-free?
Make rap records, matter of fact, thanks, peace
Pain cave uno
Smokin' a broken Blue Note
Tar pit escape artist carcass, linger in the bulldoze
Rose radio Lazarus via linear bark screaming
"I'm back to kill the video star and I'm double parked"

You can kite this or yet maybe baby you won't
Corvette, green Mercedes, steady one hundred four
When I'm stuntin', simply stunnin', funkin' with twenty monkeys
They can be like "I'm talkin' about WE"
Slap that orangutan, drop her on her knees
Please be very cautious, the funkin' makes me nauseous
Hate the Bogota, the target it ain't off it's...right here
And the volume's on three

See, we keep the black plastic stuck in the elastics
Even Chevy's heavy hallows lift you higher, legend has it
White crows crossing broken bridges
Double deucy clickin' but the round never runnin' out
Pounds of your blood just comin' out

We limelighters
Up until the uglier unplug me
We limelighters
Kill it now, fade to black comfortably
Spark the dynamite till the limelight's gone
As far as I can see the limelight stays on
And on and on and on
The limelight stays on and on and on
The limelight stays on and on and on
The limelight
So we got something built if we all die tonight
Uh, greasy grimy gopher guts
Poolside, 0 for 1, I don't forget spoons twice
Lukewarm Folgers, mold on his moonpie
Rooms in his home that dissipate into fruit flies
Suicide lane wide load ride looting in the wake of an amicable marooning
My duty go from moving in packs, to sharing food with a cat
To "Ma, it's me, I accidentally sawed a woman in half"
She said "I'll keep you in my prayers," I said "I need to hide a body"
She said "Ok, honey, talk to you on Friday"
Apparently we share a common plasma so the growing disconnection doesn't matter, according to the blood-and-water chapter
Weird, who wrote the blood-and-water chapter anyway?
Probably some surly dad, only child, 30 cats
Looking for a way to reconnect with an averted past
Except it doesn't always work like that

Today I pulled three baby snakes out of moss and dirt
Where the wild strawberry vines toss and turn
I told them, "You will grow to be something inventive and electric;
You are healthy, you are special, you are present"
Then I let them go
Oh...

You were sitting at the gate awaiting spirits and provisions
I was privy to a headache over pirouetting innards
In the mirror sweating pitchers
Who's there: simian or lizard?
As it were there is a disappearing difference
In ambition and material
Antiquated gentleman outlaws reduced to a ferris wheel of vitriol
Move as a godless heathen: black gums, tooth gone,
bootleg 'Yukon Cornelius'
I'm a... That's better, here we here we go
Disenchanted face printed on a zero-dollar bill
Got a little plot of land where authority isn't recognized
Contraband keeping the core of his Hyde Jekyll-ized
Check! Never mind a misanthrope vying for affection to the wretched sound of mysticism dying
It is something he must handle on his own
The windblown way
Wanna win? Don't play
I can't do it
Do it
Do it
Do-do it

Ian why don't you say grace
"Dear God, thanks and if you loved me, vegetables would be extinct"
Now I'm looking down the barrel of a string-bean side like an exodus of biblical proportion redefined
Rectangle seat 4, squeeze 5
Each one may not be excused from the table 'til the green gone
Stomach revvin' up an episodic rerun
Where's a dissipating plume of smoke when you need one?
Chris and Graham hate 'em too but advocate a braver chew invented for the code red, cola chaser, nose held, gulp!
Moments later, two have been released
Leaving me the legroom and the legume police
Going "freeze, you with the pretzeled arms
Send your fabricated nausea my best regards
And know this kitchen as a prison 'til the pea pods die
I could sit here all night"
So could I

(Who was at the door just now?)
Kids on dirt bikes asking you to bunny-hop the curbsides
(Really?)
Yup, I told 'em "oh he busy, he staring at his green beans being a total pussy"

Blink Twice if you are being held hostage
I speak and spell of a sleeper cell in the hospice
Woke, impersonating busy little helpers
That intimately purr between the hiccuping up of feathers
Pick a porcelain dish
A single portion canned
Frozen or fresh
Defies the glory of the Poultry or fish
Via communal bloodletting that rupture the spud levy
No '87 supper-scape was truly flood-friendly, ever
Including at your basic cemetery for contaminated textures 60 minutes into never
Where
room temp heirlooms
emanate a crude black mist
To a rendition of "dude, dad's pissed"
Tell dad dude's pissed too
Not to mention genuinely brandishing a new gill hue
Still out-mule any last strafing watchmen
'Til the lord taketh waiting as an option

(Who was at the door just now?)
Kids on dirt bikes asking you to bunny-hop the curbsides
(Really?)
Yup, I told 'em "oh he busy, he staring at his green beans being a total pussy"
(Who was at the door just now?)
Kids on skateboards asking you to navigate the claymores
(Really?)
Yup, I told 'em "oh he can't, he in the kitchen pouting and terrified of a plant"
Before shooting troops was cooler than hula hoops
High noon was your basic who's who of brutal truth
Hot summer gun or
box-cutter slow dance
Turn a young'n to a dozen paper dolls holding hands
And tricky was a wooden horse pushed up on your porch
So chicanery was yours to engage or ignore
I was on the latter, but a lot adopt pawns
So we carried lawn chairs and buckets of popcorn
(Pass the popcorn)
Brawl fair, cop car
Voyeur hawk him out his hinges, storm door splinters
Clamoring about, hammers out about to ring
Infiltrate each others tribes and murder each others queens
Packed to the very last rafter
Clung to the rafts and the cameras to capture the damage
Neck swivel with a chop chop volley
Where the ants leave nothing, but the bones and the car keys
Pardon if his two feet fester, it was rude of me people, meet left and lefter
Planted like a model of civility and honor for the sector
But never got his extra extra
Peace for the better but it wasn't entertaining
So they waited for the tazing from the safety of his haven
Like bees to the honey when they lumped you up
Cause bumper cars are only funny when they bump
Know that...

Hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance- popcorn, popcorn...
Hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance- capture the damage
(Yo, this dude talks real slow yo... Crazy
Yeah man that's my boy Steve; he just talks like that, it's weird
That is weird.)

Tune to "Hellemundo" for action packed blasphemy
Big city translate your face til it atrophy
I let the schadenfreude boy out actually
Deployed to void with grin to watch laughingly
(Yeah bitch)
Pass the P's it's a laugh in
I can smell the tragedy when hatchin'
Happily dispassionately patched in
Alive with the menace of demise
Like, "Yes!" the pain dazzles men, pass the popcorn
(Pass the popcorn)
It's reality at it's fastest
And yet it still unravels at a pace like molasses
I guess the last of the seconds before the worst of disasters stretch past us
Wouldn't you agree that it is fabulous?
In the corridors of entropous wars contort drastically tilted fits
I adjust to climates of the wilderness
Walk along my spine take the pilgrimage
Up in to the section that's reserved for the smirk of the coldest witnesses
Work you motherfuckers (hooray!), there's all day to die
Innovate the mayhem with grace
The good-form-fall, fuck if I'mma warn y'all, nah
I got the front row to the greatest entertainment that an angel never saw
Sixty thousand watts of that raw
"Pull the claw out of the trunk" fun, each one teach one how to club one
Look at how they bathe up in the dove blood
It's gonna be a night of thrills and chills where the sacred is made of mud mud...Hall of Game - Aesop

My style sits on the brink
My life's slived in a blink
My mics spun 'til the greeks redefined dizzy
My city tends to sleep when you walk and
It walks when you ain't with me

I write in Blue so I never fuck up
King felon, dumbstruck
Notice the mandible unhinging as preparatory measure in back burner binge festival
Gobbled up the rook and ran off with the queen pin spectacle
Here's to the hellbound czars and sharks
The post modernized western burn civilization
We infinite like NY kitchen cockroach infestation
Avalanched over your safety dance coma
Stare-adactyl
I lay the boogie deep beneath the porch
Sleep it off and dreams
bubbled via German Fat Caps
Snuck off beneath angel feather camo
Some believe we're sheep deteriorating
Frozen picket fence frames
Chest flames, the hazy weight's connected to the chest pain, but
I set a time for two ages to meet the owned and
Try the crop land remanence
Then jam film in the polaroid
I'm like last live specimen
Or rather last specimen to live life with my cats eye on the pendulum
Your cities broke pigpen pedigrees plow pretentiously towards the pigeonholing of a life time
So note the endless dignity sabbatical
Cause mine live in a big bass barrel
Drunk hates the bantam waiters (BUST)
One tribe trapped before the season ended (ended)
Lore to Earthworms, the string game
Paddle upstream like Bronx bound 6 trains
Tryna fill the void, lacking the link in the bliss chain(pissed game)
See which Polly Pocket prodigy doctors yacht on the war pig harbors
Unaware the blue bearded run these waters (I know)
I trap clowns leisurely for livin', period
Screaming like they didn't hear me yet

Man I rock New York City all years around
And my name is known, all over the town y'all
The people here love the way I run my game
They can't wait, to see me make the Hall of Fame (2x)

Yo its like that cape's pretty
But the float takes merit
Like vagabonds cherish cardboard and friendship
I caught a bland image showcasing the how to leap a freight car
To wait with my chin sitting space bar (know he didn't)
Shovel coal for the slick pistons benedictions
(nah don't mention it)
Just bless this pendulum's beetle bailey left right development
Tutor recruiter slap happily oblivious
To Nazi, born again, pagan, agnostic rally
It outside my apartment, by the market
It's in the park, its growing child classic
With an instant indifference to class offenses
He smashed that Perry lunge amalgum pensive
Cuz yesterday I wished upon my eyelash for a stick figure to fence with
I'm salvaged from the chaos of the student tomb
Just scrape the barnacles off my exposure
Graff's badgered latterday pioneer(first post)
First post Big Bang mobile object scoping any social prospects
A smidgen reluctant to fuck with
Tryna gallop with feet stuck in molasses's learning curve
(Yeah but the grass is burning)
Classy,
the way the horns curl backwards
Excusing soldiers from the table, no care package
(care package)
Now when the rabid walk
The slackers get amped the hasten the pacin
Knowing screams are turning cult classics
I'm moving swift but safely through the orange code medley
But discrete. Tryna make my legacy look fresh
Even From the balcony seats

Yeah
Huh
Huh
About to put it on you
Check
Huh


When the stone cold reels of  lie
Unusually congruent with this angel that flew a little too high;
Feathers burst
While the tethers nursed em' back to my side
And when he awoke he said he knows where the helium goes and why
Well I could...
Peel the sky back, revealing all the stars are merely God's unfiltered cigarettes - burning holes in the ceiling
Emerging out the grimace of the dawn of man
Shove one up for the rainmaker strain
With speaker wire vein
And honest plans
I certain
Well the tallest rainbow's gotta sit more than a cauldron of pesos and bottle ships
This anchor is more to life than failure of nozzle spits 
Plus it is big Russia split (slip?) dust in a rusted major maze, hostile sips 
Uhh
Drifter 
Watch heaven bow
Bliss kisser
Talking tank
Walk the plank
Off the
Big Dipper
Lip zipper for the common folk
Bro
You'll see
Well art and time will summon summer night lust freedom trains 
Most cretin brains will buckle
Ch'yeah
There ain't no constellation that spells flattery born
Yeah
Dance to the song of a billion little Gallileo toddlers chokin on their broke mind persony  telescope would've gazed the map illustrated  and tears bleed the common illustrated tale on the napkin
Aes Rock
Limit choker
Cross the lasso for the mister bonus 
After which the mal dog for the gimmick Quotas 
I let the beggar caught the dock with their feet danglin' for the sharks and
Siamense fighting fish to pick them apart
Ch'yeah pick 'em apart
I got a spirit that springs to life when the scissor hands slit throat modules collaborate
It's naasty
Makes the school children disrupt the class with Mrs. Crabtree
Yo Vordul catch
Show these motherfuckers how to strike a match

It's like this cats is like fish
Flowing in the ocean of my emotions
I'm often lost in isreal burning the L
Wanting to flow(float?) and get high like them birds on the block that love to get...
I'm all days trapped in the fields watching the skies
Thinking of self
Whats the worth of life
Then i learned how to burst on mics
Shine, define, and purify earth with line
Fiendin as a pigeon that turn phoenix screamin : we only livin when we got it, so freedom rememberin days when wrapped in the Eden
Gotta a light spit these raps with a meanin
Define that reason
Why a nigga breathin
Everyday get up with words that get mics fiendin
Strike even with darts
Straight from the heart
Yo this is how we do this
Escape the sky's limit with music
And this is how we do this

When the shell drop...
Its hotHello from the Spirit World
My days here have been as rewarding as they are troublesome
And often dangerous
I have been assembling my notes for some time now
My intent is to create a guide for anyone whose path
May lead them to this unwavering otherness (This unwavering otherness)
There are days I fear my work will only serve to create more confusion about what I've found
But I felt it necessary to stay the course in hopes that these insights may be illuminating for some
Contained within are anecdotes, recipes, survival tips, warnings, maps, drawings, and more
All organized in an effort to promote safe travel and interdimensional awareness
While this arrangement highlights the basic chronology of my experiences
Users should skip to whatever section most directly applies to their impending scenario
As no two Spirit World experiences are the same (The same)
Accordingly, certain passages may detail specific circumstances that you will not encounter
It is still recommended you cover these sections as to increase your general understanding of what can be expected
There will be times when you will be tested in ways this guide can neither prepare you for, nor help you from
Spirit World travel is not recommended for the faint of heart or weak of stomach
Swift and unprecedented consequences will follow your decision to breach this environment (Will follow)
With that in mind, I believe the unabridged
Spirit World Field Guide
compiled here
To be the ultimate companion for all modern supernatural tourism
As well as those potentially seeking more permanent residency
Kindest regards, Aesop Rock
And the saints come marching in
Serpentine regime ordered by response sort of fell this population
Caboose humming no fence me in a van with common patrons
The parody plastered every red brick in site
Where had to keep his plights from ticking
I'm slipping my key and whim dim by dirty tap water and that
Roach on my ceiling circling fins round a bed of pushpins
Let's connect the thrill of volume to a flat earth
Jaywalking a hook the past just passed the mere dragon bandwagon passengers
I'm sorry, we've never met, my name is driftwood
Thanks friend, good looking, I'll never see you again
Feeding frenzy, catfish stomach, empty oceans
Spangled in hooks dangled by anglers off the plank of burning books
And if you're, not gonna eat that
Kill joy inherited by spirits lacking harnesses
Merchant, Goliath dipped in slipshod posture conceived evening
So I feed idea turn sun dial to bastards son adopt the reroute dreaming
Oh I'll ride the plain bow in flare gully yellow rain coat
Heard a harp but sunny ways my lifeline searching for the same note
Oh please, I know butterfly wings ain't fit to auction
Dig my tossing sturdy walking head hung
Skylark litigants strung out like cat's cradle participants
I am the trying diaries of a low-life siphon through that feign
Anti-diligence movement
, here the hunger habitat
Working class trash raped where racist hit their high
I spy a toddler on the corner with her bubbles and her dipstick
I witness the
fusion of her breath and her amusement
And it killed me and it stabbed me and it cut me clear open
The notion that this child timid in her sins embraced pleasure
Within a token of a moment, restless arrested but not a twerp
Strip the vulnerable disclosure, so close yet so much closer
I'll take the hint but still she's never known cold
Call me in twenty when those bubbles explode it's like that

If you'd have only held the cup while I poured

Back to back to back to stacking a brick match
With the fact that I've sipped the dripping sap tap
Casually out the limbs of captivated blends back
Tracking the patterns that trim friends to thinning savages
Take one down, pass it round among us
Liquor tip a drink, drink, drunk, drunk, and drunkest
But you quest tore your floorboards and the carpet turned marbles
Naw the carpet turned charcoals amidst skeletons of warlords
Snake charmer, hate farmer, gave you the rations
With an eyedropper of poison passions hoist above the masses
And interrupts homeostasis seeming flow scapes
Like asymmetric snow flake visits and with her symmetry blizzards
I'm sleepy, one wing more and I promise to pay homage
To those who stand truly deserving and the list ain't long
Sink or swim, gravel or ascension
Even birds of iron combines float if you let them
They'll be dodging more than cradles when the bough breaks
Note the eviction slip clipped to your little visions into cloud shapes
Oh my left hand is a brick layer my right hand is a plow face
We build and destroy in response to every sound the crowd makes
Sling blades sprayed it with apathy magic balance
On the palette of the almighty for painting the first half of me
Honor find it with monster mashing in text casually
On the palette of the almighty to paint the second fraction
I'm collapsed under the relic rainbow with seven separate
Succulent
aqua marines
hide the imbibed sweetest elixir
Star heckler elitists start gawking at yet another
Real conceived green fetus beating parallel sterile fixture
Urgent, the serge is like venom and over kill, kill, kill, kill
The over spilled theory's all faucet
For real, how many leaves your clover got? Mine's got eight
Three for normalcy one for luck four more so you'll spot it from space

[A parable....What is it? Well it's a little story with a lot of truth
An earthly story with a heavenly meaning
Jesus told many parables to grown-ups and children alike
He told them simply and sincerely, in words everyone could understand
So that all might learn the lesson he was trying to teach
...]


They were selfish with the helmets on the little bus
'Till brake fluid sewage crippled up the get-retorted nickel punks
Slowly cope but swore his lowly robot vole evoke
Would one day rise in sections to interrogate the Holy Ghost


Holy smokes!
Father, black suit white collar
Kiddie porn dungeon, guns, and three fingers for your daughter's
Caught belly-up, antique Nazi paraphernalia
You cannot pay your bills with holy water and Hail Mary luck 
Shucks fucker, enjoy the Alcatraz shower fun
And mommy's mad I'm cliche generation X agnostic front
It ain't the nifty fate, the
1958, before the New-New Testament-approved Altar-boy fisting rape
And "take me to your leader"
Long as he don't manipulate toddler beaver

Call me crazy, but I bet that wasn't God's demeanor
Sodom-meter peaking 
But Long Island was Jesus every weekend
Spoon-fed to appease traditional upbringing
Of a Middle Pennsylvania shit-hole where elders movement
Stressed the stellar therapeutic Bible cycle (How?)
One church with a bait and tackle store next door and not much MORE
So the two moved to New York, made babies raised on what they'd SAW
Christmas morning smelled fresher than angel pussy
But immaculate conception came second to playful goodies
Like laser-tag was way more spiritual than blood and body wafer bags
And manger staff as long as Santa ate the cookies 
Grandma was a saint, while he'd paint with snakes and bullies
Said If only you'd memorized your prayers like you did your Kool Gs!
By the time I was old enough to know what religion was
I was Catholicism-numb and truly didn't give a 
'94: Moved out the crib and ain't seen a steeple since
What Knievel-evil seeps in a Christian leader's pitch
'Till priests' laps slapped with parental advisory warnings
I'll be auditioning Gods in my office on Monday morning
I'm a glutton where the food still shimmy and shake
Not a fingerprint to pin him to a physical plane
Probably show up as an isolated pocket of cold
Got a way of making tilapia hop in the boat
I was fending off a lizard on the dock of the lake
In Siem Reap, smoking something I forgot how to say
Maybe twenty paranoia, eighty plotted against
Palm reader calling in his archaeologist friend
It's been a long and bitter breakup with the science of sleep
I'm through the lobby on my stomach with a knife in my teeth
Brave winter, rain slicker over mutinous code
Finally free of all you fuckers I should pull through a phone
I could transform later when the gradient fade
There's a paranormal energy awake and engaged
There's a Kawasaki out behind a barn in Angkor
Money said if you could start it, it's yours

Forecast warm, leftover chicken for the dogs
I've been jumping over fences in a hundred different forms
Next week warm, message at the tone
I've been sketching on the roof or getting sketchy in the strobe
Warm, six legs circling a drain
I been swatting him for twenty, it's impervious to pain
Next week warm, rattle in the cough
I been running ragged tryna shake an apparition off

In the pitch dark searching for the source of the hex
Got a loyal tentacle in every corner of heck
Hooded figure from the wreckage of an alien ship
Nescafé washing down a snake on a stick
Spotted floating down a river tryna curse in
Khmer
With no shirt, seven days worth of dirt in his hair
When the motor finally folded to the accident prone
Had to flag another captain, phantasm in tow
I've been ignoring any semblance of relatable Earth
I got a homie from the region who could name every bird
And tell you what it is to wake up with a tank in the yard
Type of shit to make you question what your days even are
There's a holy waterfall where you could rinse and repeat
Find religion while the minnows eat the skin off your feet
If you wake me on a January morning at four
Don't get excited when I bark at the doorI'm in a red zone
That's my miracle meridian
Boundaries lined with my minute men
Slipping in
S-O-S Messages float cold, captive in glass bottles
While timidly crash-test authors spawn mountains of trash novels
Diminished
Bone Crush
Skeletal Blemish
Sportin' super-fresh caffeinated-hate
Raise amalgamated shakes for the shield (yeah)
Yield to the mood slopes
With blue notes the silent launch lifted but I think the ground shifted when I walked
Yeah I'm the very model of a modern major general
Lip-twisted
You're pitiful
Sink
I think it was the tragedies of science versus the world's technical marvels
When Thermo-Nuclear Ace left the planet chemically startled
(Startled)
(I'm very effective I might add)
How to make a homemade mummy:
Get a corpse, get gauze, get comfy
Shampoo and disinfect dead fluffy
For the hallowed excavation of his X-marked tummy
Stem to stern, the butter cutter beelines well
Tongs butterfly the unzipped feline shell
We'll be escorting vital organs
With exception of the precious kitten's heart
Into the privacy of separate pickle jars
Or mayonnaise or jelly pick a card
Shit, pick a part and scissor
Stomach, lung, intestine or liver
In a world of sanitizers and preservatives forever
Brain exterminated through the whiskers
*kiss & blow*
Ditched
I blank NY alone
We usher in the salts that call the husk home
Might embalm and stiffen and rid the fawn of all his liquids
Slather it in beeswax, wrap it up in ribbons
Like limb by limb, by tail, by ear, by chin
Within the hereafter I hereby win
I hope you vow to meow another day and never decompose
By the way before we seal these molds
The short version goes...

Take the brain out, leave the heart in
Take the brain out, leave the heart in
Paper playgrounds, meager harvest
Take the brain out...

Before we only spoke in letters cut from magazines
Folk broke bear claws over gross coffee
Not as milquetoast men, as los muertos walking

Squared-off harpy to armchair: say a prayer for me
I feel that mystifying times have gotten ugly
I also feel that you could learn a lot from a mummy

I don't need a reason to rebel
I sneak into the club I ain't leaving without a pelt
For the people feeling need to sleep i leaguered at the helm
Tryna' ease up out the nucleus and bleed into the hills
I'm a, old seed dog sippin' on fizz
My olk still put skate stickers on the fridge
Ate dinner at the Denny's with a dumbed out coven
And a company of uninvited blood hounds huffin'
Tough crowd, eat and chew the crud king, aw crud
I'm day one and two and one thing
None drum up any drama for the huffy
I ain't even lift the glove up out the pockets of the puffy
Once
(We're so excited, we don't know what to do. Because we're about to re-enter the level above human.)
(I couldn't have had a better life than I've had these 21 years. And if it was good here, I know it's gonna be twice as good when we get up there.)
(This isn't a troubling circumstance, don't take it as that. It's just a gateway, just a doorway.)
(What we're doing is we're going home. We're going home to those individuals who sent us here to do this task, and this is the happiest and joyous thing that you can-)

Alright
Raised on dirty hot dog water and popcorn butter
EPMD tellin' me every popstar a sucker
Don't let him smell the potstickers, he'll stick around for supper
He'll stick around for cheesecake, then three days, then the summer
Where spiders eat their mothers, where rodents eat their young
I'm not here to make sense where there is none, that's dumb
My attitude is ghastly, any gallantry been going gone
I think I'm probably a lot like dating Mola Ram, I should work on that
The geezer not a leader, I'm a loner
Lover, believer, upholder of the under
Just not a people person, please forgive me if I'm flustered
I'll save a thousand whales before your grits are even buttered
My name is Aesop Rock, I've been a mess for my entire life
All I know is fight or flight, what the fuck's a silent night?
Who the fuck are you to tell me who the fuck you even are
This is more than band-aids over itsy-bitsy bleeding hearts
This is GNR announcing Jesus Christ on lead guitar
Finding Heather Hunter still inside your college VCR
Mirror mirror on the wall, I feel like a fucking dog
Something this depraved is not a product of a loving God
Periwinkle Pegasus through rat-infested LEGO bricks
Hug his mother briefly, then we're off to see the exorcist
I will not be checking messages
Why, should I be?
Special is as special does, you aren't special just because
Yes, your mother said you was, that's pretty much what mothers does
Someday I might find the pluck to roam the Earth with zero strings
Cut the tether float this feather over eastern seaboard winds forever
Like sea-born kings invested in the the froth and fog
They'll talk of his adventuring and call him things like "salty dog"
He freed like a bajillion prisoners from some secret haunted vault
Always had a L to puff, never yelled "Get off my lawn!"
Full disclosure I don't even have a lawn
If I did I'd probably grow the grass until the house was gone
Kick it 'til the town forget the address or the house at all
This is how performance art exacerbates an albatross
I should maybe shake some hands
I should turn the music down
Have some people over without askin' them to move a couch
But, since you're here I've got this awful futon I could do without
Should take like two seconds...
So you want to be a carpenter, do you?
Well it takes more than a hammer, boy
You're gonna need blueprints and a will to build, and...
Straighten your cap! you look like you've been through a war
Wipe that grin off your mug, you got a sturdy frame?
Sluggish posture just won't cut it
You're gonna need schooling, and, and, and take notes!
And god if I catch you yawning again you're gonna regret ever asking for my help
And dammit you gotta hustle, this is a slacker-free zone
And, where's my pencil? Go get your hard-hat
Here's a nickel, go get us a ruler and a saw and a drill and lots of graph paper...
Yo..
I used to have a rope ladder but tattered were the rungs
I strung it from the highest willow, trying to hug the sun
The seventh level buckled and I tumbled from the summit
Now I'm back to re-climb and this time light my cigarette from it
My stitch in division/division warfare's numb enough to soak suddenly in a bullet bath and skip stones in the morning
Is a flying color phantom tantrum explicable?
Sit and pull the petals off wild flower patches, magic happens!
Behold, pity the lowlife parish?
Doom City barracks left remorse coursed on a horse-drawn carriage by the torch of Polaris
To the badlands, where every bridge collapse right where the crowd stands
Where the witches are fireproof and every preacher's a madman
Frigid be the appleseed demeanor towards the bay where the landshark Parliament swims
When they pause to polish they fins
The better brains will preach the village through the city square
To the light, heavy and middle-weight integrate
Slept with sticks and stones in my pillowcase
Ooh my born flight simulator picks barnacles off the tugboat belly
Left my spirit home in a shoebox in case I die
Got a rugged smoke-green halo floatin' inches off the swamp
Had that phase when the deviltry contacts a sparkle in my eye
Now step back from the reservoir and let the settlers drink (Right!)
Salvage all priorities and iron out all kinks (Okay!)
My house ain't made of bricks and straw but never has it crumbled (Why?)
Cause I stitched the brain's rigidity with symmetry
Come visit me, it's fascinating
Burn it down...

Pad the circles 'round your life
To capture all the sides you sight
Magic tricks where skeptics sink
The ice is thin, stay off the lake
Waiting for a clock to punch
Wish I could breathe and stop for lunch
If I stop to count the leaves on only one of these here trees
Not sure that I know what's pure
Born to kill the insecure
Some respect, some resent, some remain from start to end
Wear my heart on my short sleeves
I'm stuck out here, I lost my keys
From the roof I watch the street
And pray for those that's caught beneath
[Slug,
Aesop Rock
]
As long as I know right from wrong
I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs
As long as I know right from wrong
I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs

I dunno what I have left
To give other than truth and breath
Angel when she shuts her eyes
Like we will leave to my demise
Between my time is short
About to start my last resort
Wake me up when it's time to make babies
Talkin planet earthquakes
Tied the laces, touch the ground
Let emotions ruptured now
As long as I know right from wrong
I'll be ok I'll sing my songs
[Chorus: Aesop Rock,
Slug
]
As long as I know right from wrong
I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs
As long as I know right from wrong
I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs
As long as I know right from wrong
I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs
As long as I know right from wrong
I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs
Love note to the whole fuck show
Postmarked from a lighthouse in the blunt smoke
Dear motherfuckers, I'm teetering, if you must know
Wolf at the door like a bug to the fructose
Niece on the phone saying, "Ian, you should visit more"
We could build forts while the pigs court civil war
Miss you, miss you more, see you on the far side
Scuffed shoes, couple new scars in the archive
I'm not here to pull scarves out
Here to pick tumblers underwater with his arms bound
From in chains to the heart of where art thou
I'm out there down to throw grapnel at a guard tower
Down to spray piss on a cop car
It's rage in the form of Renaissance art
Can't treat it like a job at the stockyard
And feign shock when they turn the block to a pockmark
Stock parts knocking on Mach 1 to Camp Lo
Amped up eyes glowing unknown pantones
Drive 'til it feels like a Van Gogh
Lest I cheetah me some antelope
Partly cloudy, palpable panic in the troposphere
Wake a giant, poke a bear, we don't do smoke and mirrors
We do do a medkit and spare clothes
Leave a motherfucker nowhere close
New superpower that I picked up in a frenzy
I could draw a roof on fire from memory
Each and every sketch another bloodletting
In a wake of escalation and excessive rubbernecking
The champ can't look away, drink it in
Strobe lights, smoke, no life, no lifeguard, sink or swim
Ring around the king of pain, bring acetaminophen
You either see the vision or dinner with demolition men
Boom
Flame to the fuse to the barrel
I step into the room, split an arrow with an arrow
The first trick shot is just to show them that I dabble
I will not be aiming for the apple
Lately, I treat every interaction as a living wake
Thanking people close to me before the photo pixelate
New day, folk down to play the game different
Changed and going from being chased to playing chicken
Get your whole roadmap Pac Man'd
Black mask snack on whatever's in the dash cam
It's not an ad, hashtag, or a tap dance
Patsy, the revolution will not have jazz hands
I know you're alien to matters of the heart and mind
That shit that make you park the car and scream into the dark of night
Some days, I wanna build a rocket to the Kármán line
Ten, nine, eight, keep your head and arms inside, yeah(Verse 1)
Whistles, bells, ten by ten cells
The peasants in the seven ten split that never fell
Who print a third rail tiger twine débutante situation
And pencil me in  we'll see if we can't make you famous
The operetta sunk by sunken skulls fed the chubby tenor jealousy  format
Dawned with that angelic shimmer similar to my brothers first four-track
Cocooned  high school inconsistent success callbacks
"I don't want to hear you whinin' 'bout you coulda shoulda woulda been a pilot"
Well that's a beautiful regret, that I couldn't quite hear
I was busy flying by it in my SR-71 Blackbird soul-craft
With license dangling for middle digit wiln' "How are you?"
Feeling restless, incredible sense of full galaxy bench-press off the resting sight
Icicle atmosphere surface corpse of a once lovely now ugly demeanor
Yanked out the grab bag of poison  "Presto change!"
 unconditionally
Bully up in a mixed species for the stargazers, scruffy puppy dog car chasers
"That's right" I amaze the hex enough to breathe for a second
But in that same breath, he reloads his weapon
It's bigger than the most rugged embodiment of malice
Dances with the skeletons, and paints a velvet hell I'm in
Aside from, slide slick humanoid snake tongue hybrids
Stood the net that draped over my TV set
(Hook)
It's I against it, Jinx Planet
It's it vs. the pennies in my pocket, Jinx Planet
Plus my will to drink drama, Jinx Planet x 7
It's I against it, Jinx Planet
It's it vs. the pennies in my pocket, Jinx Planet
Plus my will to drink drama, Jinx Planet x 7
(Verse 2)
It's a Jinx Planet, jeopardy on the canvas
Tryin' to shepherd leopards from the archive and the annex
Like maggots gut the belly of that fallen elk
Human barnacles starship kamikaze to market to buy and sell
He said there ain't gone' be no revolution 'til the mutants fell
To my sweet lullaby, now they gonna scuttle by speechless
The yes-men nod in perfect syncopation, statin' SURE!!
But I leave my sures/shores to the beaches, where the hell-nos wash up frequent
"Stuck in a mortal" Stuck in a mortal mannerisms with a definite death
Flashing the etiquette of veteran gems
My tenement stems from where the burners burn best
"Stuck walking  a flat Earth simulation murder churn fest" Blatant!
Primal traitor defiling all the parties purity
 cross breath meshed with king of pain elixir senseless
Drink and purge a thousand years of resentment in seconds
"And right then I broke his weapon"
 things forever in a plank, like ain't no dragon alien of Fahrenheit infinite measure
Swift peregrine falcon split  this planet's tilt
Around the wretched refuse Aesop and his little cannon built
We thrive in the event horizons offering
Slide to the event's half baked subsidiaries when
Every enriching stitch wishes to back themselves out of a hidden 
Cycling the brink of something makers more beautiful than this link
What-what, w-what's that?

I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm a slow burn, crawl around the road work
Something from the other side clawing at the known world
Cough up all your cookies with the autumn air incarnate
He all-city by the time your eyes adjusted to the darkness
In parts uncharted, always find the corners cozy
You can send your fastest riders, I return the horses lonely
Controller, the locals only note the lucky charms and army jacket
When your addy's in the heart of thar be dragons, I know
No solicitors, waves away his visitors
From ten minutes in front of a tainted energy signature
Still bullseyeing womp rats from the scenic route
Sugar in his coffee like a séance in the TV room
The cheek swab came back half-amazing
Half of what he make end up on his lab apron
If quieter than most, I'm mostly mastering the science of
Keeping one's composure while the limbic system's lighting up

Some try to combat any kind of odd force tryna make contact, nah
Let it in, let it in
Let it in, let it in
Some try to stonewall any kind of woo-woo tryna make a phone call, nah
Let it in, let it in
Let it in, let it in

Let it in, let it in
Let it in, let it in
Let it in, let it in
Let it in, let it in

Ring around the revenant, let it in
Said he wasn't ready yet, he never left the Etch-a-Sketch
Stuck around for more than just a parlor trick or flickering fluorescents
Had a couple still to visit with a million pressing questions
Like, where you the night of?
What are you traversing Earth in spite of?
How are you adjusting to the triumph?
I'm asking for a friend who caught a loss and never surfaced
Simply curled up in his cubby, shutting down the central nervous
Look, float up into urgent care, a checkerboard of blurry squares
Flowers in the lobby shrivel back into the earthenware
Humans in the lobby holding crosses up
I understand the caution but
Some of you just wanna see the coffin jump
Until the coffin jump, then it's what I call a punk
Didn't even get to where he coughing blood and talk in tongues
Not to mention, once you hassle the hoard
It doesn't matter how much furniture you stack at the door, yeah
Check it out y'all
Pull the pin
Count to five
Top to bottom tonight
Borough watch, Jux war(?)
Savage, overkill
Definitive, red carpet
Cupcakes, iced right now
On time

Same hand that snuggled the barbed wire
Tug an orphan assortment of bell and three-alarm fire
Beautiful loser maneuver the goofy cubicle future alert
Big brother super-community burn
OK shoppers, tickets won't last
For the straight-to-video "Dog-Boy eats glass"
Who BMX match rotate on guerilla Babylon
Darwin on a peg taking his innervate to tag along
Ape escape gravitron, surly with two caps
One over the mask while plugging the flak back(?)
And it was, home depot for the five finger lazy lift
Ironically the same five measure the spray radius
Spray gradient, baiting for city tetris
Double-breasted hecklers bark at picket fences
Now mobile rogues develop a special network
Which further upsets the rich 'til rubberneckers double-check us
(Zero)
Tonight the scum dance and I got all my money on the one with the lung cramps
Little rat in the maze, they score him on his escape
Sorta likes the attention so he says check-in and stays
Answer: how do we record a documentarian suffering
While ushering the public's hands in
Or transfer greedy bruiser to user-friendly stanzas?
I guess it's like a junkwad full of dondy's candice
Product, Noun: a tampered-with, contaminated shrink-wrapped variant of the process, wow
As written by the messenger pigeons of Hell's Kitchen
Thank you for the dollar, hope you dig it
I could drive a car through a fence
Bonnie sitting shotty, not Barbie and Ken
Probably dip instead of weathering your whims and woes
The piss and moan, I prefer sticks and stones
From the unrelenting filigree of digital Rome
I throw a signal fit to eclipse videodrome
More than pics of your pets, every pixel explodes
And viewership has an emotional and physical toll
I'm a 8-bit invader who vacate the cartridge
Upgrade, now I make waves in the lawless
Y'all still decorate a office in rainbows and dolphins
Basically awake in a coffin
Hmm, Chrissy tattooed his middle finger
Took from his mother, tools from his headshrinker
Duck a death-bringer, ain't bringing me shit
I'm right here, bitch, swing and a miss
, hiss

Speak from a circle of seats
Each get a turn,
I'm the king of world peace
W- W- World peace
W- W- W- W- World peace
Teach 'em how to curse at police
And flee from the church
,
I'm the king of world peace
W- W- World peace
W- W- W- W- World peace
Good evening
All right
Yeah
Happy to be breathing
Yeah
I am alive
Yeah
Yeah

"You look like you've seen a ghost"

Are you asleep? Or are you
Are you awake? Nah, man, I'm done
I'm showered, I'm everything
Ate some fuckin' Lucky Charms
Let's go

Most copious, rains soaked the opiates
Notice how the phobias appropriately procreate
Woke up with a ghost farm, focused on his groceries
When they aren't telling stories, they are multiplying grossly
On the lawn, let 'em loiter, never let 'em spawn
The apparitions have been drinking his water for too long
So when they gathered by the birdbath in the morning, he would tell 'em
"I mean no disrespect but you have all outstayed your welcome"
Interesting in a sense
Interrupt commiserating phantoms on your picket fence
How quickly they will lift their heads
And breathe an ultimatum like the dead don't argue
Said, "You're living by the bayonet (but how alive are you?)"
Shit, A is all juice and bad etiquette
Elbows on the table, lobster bibbin' on the ready set
He said, "But how alive?", I dunno, homie, you decide
(No, you decide) Fine!
How alive? Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive (How alive?) Too alive
And one by one around the yard 'til each one felt communal pride
Like they had done their little part in cleaning up the public
With a steaming plate of justice for them Easy Baker stomachs
(Say what?)
We the legends that hunt with the unremembered
Geriatric lore in the clutch of the budding censor
Who snuck around the art police and all related governments
To infiltrate a human lung and hike up off his tongue and lip
Ahh, money's in the market for a mothership
To double as a vessel that drag his legacy under it
And who am I to hang him out to dry by the heat
When, if rehydrating fails, we're all dumber because of me?
Zombies of the antiquated nation chatter quietly
The "Too alive" channel from the library of rivalry
And summers in the mud (Mud), winters by the tracks (Tracks)
No story goes untold, Aes is back
Hey stupid, you're listening to Bazooka tooth, dental cannons, molar pistols; shit like that
This is Murs, motherfucker, this is Aesop Rock, Ace Rizzle. Ya know what I'm saying? Check it out, like, Living Legends, Def Jux,
if you don't know, now you're informed
Be better prepared for the next time this type of shit goes down. Cause when it's happening and you're unaware you look like a complete asshole
(Baddest motherfucker touching down on kick drums)

Every leader dead and it's making you upset
La da de dah da da, La da de da da da dow dom
Set, set, set...
Every hero dead and it's making you forget
Get, get, get
La da de dah da da, La da de da da da dow dom

I'm in and out a pig channel serrated for hand feeders
Army of vicious kitchen patrol yam peelers
They sleep in barns and whisper loony conspiracy secrets
Increasing payroll awareness blind while a.w.o.l. went the leaders
The only mammal officially banned from food chain comp
For finishing for over 25 consecutive years on top is aggravated
Alarmingly, the pulse don't bump right
And he's up nights
Bumping over crunk and bug bites
Who luck like this evening?
Stay electric mud blood jockeying for the footing
My last supper starts with a vinaigrette over pickled Muppet hearts while sheep tuck deep in the wood chipper
For the shepherd was a milk carton and scissors
Clammy hands make henna run on risky jenga tugs: you're all sweating, Hell I'm sweatin' too, just ain't nobody sweatin' you!
(Holmes!)
The muck went abacus on labor perspirator official biz
When auditioning demos by which to live
No whammies, Stop
Your triple six game never chose me
Trickery gets hokey
Pick up sticks and ponies
You've got mail, champ: blow me
Just trooper with a question mark machine needy
Pointed at the heavens like a Bee Gee on some where the hell's my freebee?
To clamp war stupid
No landlords or super
No hands
Water no ice cubes Rubik, no plans
No motor movement, no dance, no pyrotechnics to enhance
No chance
Too many grown men call in sick over cramps
I weigh in heavy on the jaded bitter subtracting the frontal gimmick
I want to solve world hunger and fuck a pin-up
I want to find a 21st century carbon crutch worthy of pedestal placement and shitty path walking to touchWhen you see my foot rapidly tapping upon the floor boards you should take it as my not being amused with the display
When you feel my finger rapidly tapping upon your skully you should pack a bag with food and clothes and walk the other way
It's now for the crumb bloodhound serendipity movement
Alien a triplicate stooge counter culture
Forty first thief dispatchee, they shake a stick at
My fins break water circling shoulder chips dipped in a well to rape the origin
Fresh sneaker bows idle all killin'
Day tripping I beaker spillin, right?
I treat the cursed burners of my Zen like pendulums and let 'em count the seconds 'til the big hand strikes to scissor clip the string in your box kites
I got that thousand yard stare
'til the hounds howl
Jackal walker stripped the market bare
Dig it, it's all modern logistics
See, the slaves work for assholes, and the assholes work for kings
And the kings work for hookers, cocaine and forefinger rings
Snake tongue, hung a rung above the rest
Slung while a pink lung stung and sunk to an ebony vest
Bad spirit
Fad pyramids rust in the shadows of this cat on a hot tin something
Spittin disgusting
Ready to rain
Indian summer under a fragile pain comforter
Stain glass palace
Brain gas baggage
Sum of separate pieces equals freight class imbalance on a palette made of snake bones
Graf' work, A poem
Kill 'Em All
Yeah jig, I'm awful with aesthetic
Mach 20 (30, 40, 50...)
Why money, what you up to?
"Oh, I was just about to, uh..."
Trying to graduate to gum shoe
Here to preach the great American fuck you, so fuck you
Aesop rock dropped his lip to floor
Shoved the mile stones in his mouth, chewed 'em up and spit the core
So the captives of the slapstick handshake trade embargo
Crunched on a fortune cookie tomorrow opening question marked parcels
I absorb bliss for the futures model samaritans
By exposing the vain roots of the hear-us-now plain truths
But I won't
Life lessons curdle in the stomach prior to sink into the sense capsules
As discipline fractals
Now 'course necessities says let the brain jolt awkward
Set it free
Just take note if your walk's irrelevant
Excuse me, for example if Moses had gills he could have fished without the split-sea macho circus
But he didn't and it don't really make a difference
I'm cooked
I've been around the universe twice
The first time I sat and looked
The second time I broke the galaxy
Now I walk with a limp cause my foot's coated in casualties
A small price to pay for a life of, "Greetings, your Majesty"
Spread a billion apple seeds to honor his vision of underprivileged children
Plucking the fruits in their ripest hour
But the dreams have gone sour
Cowards dug up the roots
Weaved the leaves, hung up a noose and sacrificed their freedom vouchers
He did it in the name of Christ
She did it for the grunt work
He did it for the star cluster that he'd named after his mother
Now it's touching, and it makes a great story to tell
But I'd rather be the wisher than the penny in the well
Hey Kirby
Whatcha doing Kirby
Whatcha doing there
Hey Kirby
Whatcha doing Kirby
Whatcha doing there

Hobgoblin, shots of hot Strongid
Vaccine queen deem church socks hostage
9 weeks awesome, hides in a slipper
Look in her eye like she might be a wizard
Cold met a cat lady in a parking lot
She got the heroes of tomorrow in a cardboard box
And probably hoarding 40 more in the corners of Fort Knox
Swapped 20 on the spot and cop the warlock
Back at the haunt, found God in the hamper
Briefs on her head playing Walking With a Panther
Good around misery and golden era samplers
Jeopardy and Wheel at the heels of her handlers
Bet, more than a pet to worship
It's an MD recommended sense of purpose
Here to bat around keys and the means to euphoria
Soon to be hailed, the greatest of all warriors

Hey Kirby
Whatcha doing Kirby
Whatcha doing there
(I'm not takin' no shorts)
Hey Kirby
Whatcha doing Kirby
Why'd you eat that leaf (Yo, yo, yo)

Homie don't fetch, only woke to stretch
Under a thought bubble rich with bowls of goldfish
Skittish in the company of stranger danger
Otherwise, chase draw strings, tails and lasers
In a steel cage match with a maze of cables
Brazen, game-face based on Azazel
Oversized ears up, puke in the Meow Mix
Shred a pair of earbuds, remedy his cowlick
: Thanks Kirbs, looking like a milli
Keep an old man sharp, keep a cold Chantilly
Spun plum dizzy in a frisky moment
Never lands on her feet though, I think she's broken
Mouser in training, nap on the toaster
Decorate her cubicle with dogs playing poker
15 years taking prescriptions
Now a shrink like, "I dunno, maybe get a kitten"
I am a man who uses the techniques of a bat to navigate...

Can't motherfuck a motherfucker
From the underfunded klutz who never undercut the butcher
The pick-a-booger-at-your-wake is bumping "I'm your pusher"
Also at your wake, juvenile intruders at the gate
Brooding over waking history that bubbles
From the blinking 12s of VCRs and Microwaves
Like time machines for shrinking elders
Rifling through their recipe, carrots, onions, celery
What unique amalgam of piss and repugnant energy
Spun him out of the '70s, to beeline for dessert?
Fire-eater trying to keep it on the green side of the dirt
This is tea-time with the worst
Geriatrics on the decline of berserk
Back in my day we were three times more alert
Now I go through my old clothing
Trying to find nostalgic threads to sell
Walk away feeling like I should have never dressed myself
Sincerely I was never on the cutting edge, my hand was on the hilt
You're free to build with the other end
Shriek into the vacuum if in spite of your accomplishments
You wake up feeling empty like Houdini's grave probably is
Volley with the quintessential digital ager, I'm offended by everything
My opinions come in a manger, oh boy
Depreciating since they drove me off the lot
Still into ghost stories and pot and the classic coconut bra
Procedural crime drama shows with holes in the plot
And reminding clones there's more to coping
Than a nose full of snot
Ah, old pros throw 'bows to the 808
You couldn't throw a rope over a baby gate
Bishop to queen 4
in
Damn Daniel
s
under ram skulls
Plan for cloudy with a chance of anvils
Fever dreams of padded cells and jagged pills in frozen pipes
Socialites from pageant hell with plastic smiles and robot eyes
I'm hoping you all grow into the sentience you assume
As your moment of self-reflection is a moment for me too
Look, with the steel chair, sure to serve the veal rare
Brush up your evasion and basic tactical field care
I was on that constant futile rage before the internet
I been ignored for longer than you've been interested
The posse promise you nobody feels threatened by a scarecrow covered in crows who feel welcomed
That's like hellions thinking Hell is just OK but needs some polish
It helps to know intimidation's all about the optics
Come duck a bounty, it's a hoot, Suffolk County, it's a zoo
Puppy chow and bitches brew, it's not exactly chicken soup
It's heavy lifters lifting, it's ginseng on his whistling
It's we don't find the flippancy convincing, two for flinching
Older yeller, never knew a no-kill shelter in his doggie days
Now I draw my neighbors over kouign-amanns and coffee stains
A walled and whirling urchin, more observant than audacious
I document the great unwashed and curse in Lithuanian
For a gallery of grifters channeling Sid's action figures grafted
With his little sister's after markers, glue, and scissors
It's trippy, the truth and fiction moving to a center
Maybe it's weirder they've never been photographed together
Sometimes the stomach disappears from under a retreating lens
And patterns of a need to please abusive folk reveal themselves
I'm peeling back the layers, I'm sneaking past the lasers
I'm a lover, I'm a fighter,
I'm a seed to blackened acres
The dogs I think are following me home are out to kill me
Your music makes a motherfucker wanna move to Elm Street
Rejection of the spirit by the body at your service
If you mess-up every friendship come get swept up in the current
Here, wheels fall off of cars when they see him
Seas part, green trees march out of Eden
I'm known to eat the heart and
keep the archery uneven
Are you starting to be part of the kinesis?

Got me on some other shit
Got me on some other shit
Got me on some other shit
I shouldn't even be here, mum's the word
I burn down the house
,
I gum up the works
I'm the wrong vibration to summon to Earth
When the cuffs break, better make enough of the cure
I go proto-human, I'm so unruly
Architect of my Kodokushi
En garde, hop in the box of chopped arms
On the blocks beyond the pop art stockyard
Got a red phone right to the inside
I could turn a ribcage into windchimes
You don't wanna engage, kiddo, it's a burden to bear
It's a whirlybird, nervous in the surface-to-air
I lost count of the cooks, every coward and crook
Every memory or semblance of an, "Out of the woods"
I'm two unrubbed elbows well in the weeds
Even the good eye couldn't find the edge of my seat
Oh, potpourri of confusing powers
All mashed together and shooting outward
Intel gleaned from the prince of dark
Scarecrow every ten for infinity yards
When a spirit and vessel consider living apart
It's official, I ain't sign up for the mission to LARP
My call of duty stay all-consuming
Even if y'all see him as a dollar movie
, look
Best in show, I'm the worst there is
That pest control is no urban myth
That floating skull just won't shut up
It's on a business trip from below the crust
Y'all know what's up
Bad news from the black lung
Used to flatline, the shit is so last month

Territorial organisms
Each glorifying our poor decisions
I'm a force,
you could forecast swarming insects
Who eat all the corn like war is business
I pageant wave from my shallow grave
Patch me in from that astral plane
Ain't ring the bell, I pass through the walls
A cool burgundy in both tooth and claw
Midnight manage an incredible feat
A GPS collar on the neck of the beast
It go, beep-beep, any neck of the reef
Put a reaper on a second week of medical leave
I'm a seer, I could tell you how the curtain descend
Or maybe hint at how it isn't with a circle of friends
I go bah with the black sheep, rah rah, catch me a patsy
Spaz, unravel, and blaspheme
Riddler to keep the gate
It's a groundhog D-Day, Jesus H
I was born on a horse at a steeplechase
My forte's frontline real estate
Plus steak and frites, I take bloody as hell
If it burn black, point him at the honey and milk
I ain't sitting while you sully the well
I turn up in a jiff, jackknife when I jump in the pit
One hundred hands, one million eyes
Two bleeding gums, I will survive
That last line's rose-colored only for a limited time
It all shifts when you militarize
I had a vision of a feather on a seasonal wind
In the shadow of a gargoyle fleeing the brick
Lean in, steal your chips
Where I'm from, y'all wouldn't even be in the mix, ayy
I shouldn't even be here, mum's the word

Who put the monkey wrench in well-oiled perfectionist emblem
Just to watch these monitors spit white noise through your office space
Automater, I infect jolly gene pool descendant clown-clusters
Brushing dust mites off your starving art revolution sound jugglers
Delinquent friend from brick habitat
Bob, weave, stick, move, fence
And pause somewhere in the middle for slick invention
This years
brain crops spread spectacular
, I ain't mad at ya
Don't stay mad at the caliber (
I twist characters like Twist characters
)
Tally up the alley cat aggression in this Doug E. Fresh infested
Mess of bass line lust and automatic b-boy Krylon can combust circuit
Working these war pig cyphers
with Ted Striker stability
And kamikaze chivalry
I alone
noble in a worm food feud
Walking dead generation
Ain't nobody asking for your patience
The grand opening holding me to face the fact
I knew myself and didn't have to ask nobody else
(Talk about labor)
Fantastic planet urchin putting work in
Searching for pertinent verse minus the murderous diversion
Apologies won't lure me to the communal sob story
Nor will I sacrifice live style to benefit jury temperament
This old Green Goblin web cutter butts up against
Crayola daydream landscape spitting bedlam.
Dead 'em
Charge the villagers nickels and nicotine to watch him fed to
One disgruntled kraken at high noon
We'll sell popcorn beer and balloons
I got an inkling this gon' be the one the children bicker over
It's that Warriors vs. Baseball Fury element
To glitch his motor sensory development
I am a star, really
That Big Bang bastard's back with a one-way ticket to beat street
This all is like, relevant to human kind supply/demand ratios, man, learn it
I work past the surface
I work on what I love, I work to service all my burdens
And I'll work until this here little flat line closes the curtainsAesop Rock -
Labor Days
(Super fresh)

My spirit animal comes with a pretzel bun
Troll of the treadmill
Record on the Kessel Run (allegedly)
Edgy from elevenses to Megabucks
Techies with the treble down
This is how we level up
Dead meat, time travel, pressure, and disease
As ushered out of two fingers pecking at the keys
The coping mechanism in his LMNOP's
Went from healthy to unhealthy to a hell he never leaves
Cineplex Jesus, curse at the curly fries
Mulling over Chuck D telling me, "Diversify"
I'm at the Supercuts soupin' up the wardrobe
Forecast looking like Ganesh on four phones
"Hello, hello, hello, hello"
Base camp, space camp
Bass in your face fuck, brace for the rain dance
Back in the back of the classroom
After a magical nap in a vacuum

Act natural, whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you
(Superfresh)

Before climbing douchebag mountain, I was skate or die
Started eating kale and came to terms with my lazy eye
Putting on the yoga lady, cutting off The Cable Guy
Whistle while you're waiting for your condition to stabilize
AV cables everywhere, every piece of vinyl scratched
Mentholated Tiger Balm
,
Aleve with the arthritis cap
Irons and the niacin, iron Quiet Riot mask
Unabashed privacy expanding into simulcast
40 winks, never the same adventure
Refreshing, or the single longest exorcism ever
In the end, you gotta wonder if it's even worth the effort
No stairways into Heaven, you can step into the Escher
Some people have mistaken my allegiance for a weakness
It fucked me up for eons, I wished I was a theist
The type to fake his death then forget he faked his death
Show up on TV, in the crowd at the AVNs, like...

Act natural, whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you
(Superfresh)
Chicken noodle thermos, parka marching out the army surplus
Over thermals over thermals over thermals over thermals
, look
Owl on my shoulder, initials on the katana
Whispering something wicked through a moisture-wicking balaclava
Not a cop in sight, not a watt of light in the fog
Silent night to God almighty just from lighting cigars
Not a creature is stirring to purging lightning from the eye on my palm
Wide as long as y'all can die and re-spawn
Still going, if only a vehicle for merino wool
Who volunteer to wake to St. Bernards for the foreseeable
I'm edumacated on every threat in the trade
Started checking the checker for any legerdemain
Caught 'em fudging the numbers and hiding birds in they coat
Burning phones and computers inside a circle of stones
When policing the people is, "Please return to your homes"
You get a people determined to take a turn in the strobe

I found something in the woods I wanna show you
It just might change how you float around the O2
You was like, "Okay, bet," drove twenty minutes (Drove twenty minutes)
Looked for thirty seconds, said, "Can I get a witness?"
Went home different
Went home different

Two pair of socks under reindeer mukluks
Aiming to keep ten pigs awake in the tundra
Plaza to plaza, thermometer going nuh-uh
My posse out of pocket on some occupy the umbra
If it's under freezing, I don't even wanna know a number
Just show me to the rolling thunder, wubba, wubba, wubba
Today a mall cop told me I should get a life
Double black diamond
,
a pirate to private property
Lion-hearted pioneer of high Garbology
First archer to set the firestarter oxen free
Defending some forgotten block of uncommon geometry
Before they fixed the road, there used to be this bump to bump
I guess in '97, so and so did such and such
In Timbs on someone else's board
Tell the story, spread the lore
It's epic to a people who would rather push than teleport
Postcards from the pink bath paint leisure
As a cloaked horse through a stained-glass Saint Peter
Hack faith-healer, cheat death to the very end
Cherry wooden nickels on his specs for the ferrymen
X-O, Zodiac a pentagram expo
Pet Cemetery in electric fresco
Abaddon threshold, flash forged in a galley
With undead orcs pulling oars through the algae
Smash cut to a smoke-bombed quarantine
Guards like, "All signs correlate with sorcery"
It's more a dormant cell of valor as awoken by the smell of sordid power
And defecting shortly after
Fist bump dry land, brackish
Cat nap 15,
back to swiss-cheese the flagship, uh
Blue in the menacing grip of a day for which you're manifestly unfit

Final answer "not to be", "not to be" is right!
Next question - to build winged shoes or autophagy
Silk-screen band tees, take apart a VCR
Ringer off, canned peas,
cabin fever mi amor
Patently adhering to the chandelier at key-in-door
To usher in the understated anarchy of leisureforce
Led a purple tongue and ratty Caballeros
Up over the black rainbow into the house of mirrors
To become a thousand zeroes, echoing a twisted alchemy
Freak flags, fluttering to circadian free jazz
Sleep apnea, scratching, "bring that beat back"
I doze off, clothes on, nose in the feedbag
Shhh... Om nom, nom,
blinds drawn
Compost thrown to the spine pile, bygones
Mangy, intimately spaced pylons
On a plot of inhospitable terrain,
"Hi mom!"

Crows beak, cold night, unmoored virtue

Pain cave uno
Smokin' a broken Blue Note
Tar pit escape artist carcass, linger in the bulldoze
Rose radio Lazarus via linear bark screaming
"I'm back to kill the video star and I'm double parked"

You can kite this or yet maybe baby you won't
Corvette, green Mercedes, steady 104
When I'm stuntin', simply stunnin', funkin' with 20 monkeys
They can be like "I'm talkin' about WE"
Slap that orangutan, drop her on her knees
Please be very cautious, the funkin' makes me nauseous
Hate the Bogota, the target it ain't off it's right here
And the volume's on three

See, we keep the black plastic stuck in the elastics
Even Chevy's heavy hallows lift you higher, legend has it
White crows crossing broken bridges
Double deucy clickin' but the round never runnin' out
Pounds of your blood just comin' out

We limelighters
Up until the uglier unplug me
We limelighters
Kill it now, fade to black comfortably
Spark the dynamite 'til the limelight's gone
As far as I can see the limelight stays on
And on and on and on
The limelight stays on and on and on
The limelight stays on and on and on
The limelight
So we got something built if we all die tonight

She think she piss champagne and shit caviar
Don't watch the stars, the stars ain't fallin'
Any sight of glimmer Lo
Shimmering king, spring, they're tremb-ling

Check it, in a box marked "divinity", I trap the trinity
Of honor, evolution, and serenity
Pulled the reign into me
This archetype hyped oddities of style
Lost child prodigy intrigued
Fatigued by a suit and tie spy claiming post-Modern peacemakers
With the worlds ends calibrated in their briefcases
Case em when the sun bursts...
And the populace awaited my reply:
I spit a billion tiny, brilliant white lights into the sky
(What)
When your last murmurs fade like colors in graff burners
Soon to be flustered and clustered in with comrade trash hurlers
Color me a sideline observer, alerted not yet retreating
And the climate stubbornly hovered slightly above freezing
Penny for your reasoning, Doug, which luckily I ain't as blessed to hold your attendance
So I could slide my guided tenants on the one
That drop in the bucket boogie begun
Brick in the wall installments draw a fallen performance
Fifth element, critical endurance
Kingpin allow only the murkiest swamp bot
To slip beneath the skin, this is Aesop
Recording til your TDK stops
Watch laboratory clone demotions dodge on natural hate crops
With the bearers of the reptile smile
Again and again, blendin' a friend with a fiend
Lending' a bended dream
Keen, cold, the straight soul drenched, temper
Fuckin, back boogie, I'm a settler
Kids wanna know the Aesop Rock...
The off the top, prototype, straight RoboCop
If you're Quasimoto, and you're slo-mo to stop
Ya rock bells
, I block spells casted
If you wanna straight flaccid pass me towards... you
What? Kids wanna jet? 'Tis I, the 6 foot 4 space cadet
All up in you, kids wanna bend you back
So who's the next kid to rock upon the track?

With a body length of about 20 centimeters
Bullfrogs are the largest frogs in North America
As well as the champion jumpers

Long Legged Larry was a frog at the pond
Jump so high, might miss him while he gone
Jump over anything, even King Kong
Jumping Jack Flash was his favorite song
Now once upon a time there was a cat in a tree
Chased a squirrel up, been stuck since three
The fireman came, said "It's too high for me"
How's that cat gonna ever get free?
Young Jack Turner was a staple on the block
Said he knew about a frog with an XL hop
The neighbors started laughing, but Jackie wouldn't stop
Ran off, came back, guess who he got?
Well, it was Long Legged Larry, didn't open his mouth
Like a rocket to the moon through a cumulus cloud
Touch down safe, lay the scaredy-cat on the ground
If you listen real close, you can still hear the crowd

Go Larry, go Larry, go, go, go Larry
Go Larry, go Larry, go, go, go, go, go

Larry doesn't care
Jump so high grow a beard in the air
Jump over anything, even Times Square
Yelling "Long Legged Larry for mayor!,  Here! Here!"
Now once upon a time there was a princess in a cell
In the tower of a castle, through a forest on a hill
Half the men that ever sought her out had fallen ill
All the men that ever tried to climb the wall had fell
Handful gather at the base of the place
Each claim way braver than the bravest you've faced
Bunch of dingbats yapping about saving the day
But wait, a silhouetted amphibian face in haze
Well, it was Long Legged Larry on the back of a steed
Leapt up yelling "Jordan!" Kiss the girl on the cheek
Touch down safe, show the lady back to her peeps
If you listen real close, you can still hear the streets

Go Larry, go Larry, go, go, go Larry
Go Larry, go Larry, go, go, go, go, go
The kid that work down at the local Baskin-Robbins
Got a tattoo of a lipstick print attached above his collar
I watched him relocating pistachio to a waffle
Thinking I had lost the plot if not the passion for the novel
He asked me what I wanted, I ordered something daft
He said he liked the tattoo Alex drew me of the bats
Thanks;
I like it too but modestly confess
In present company, my coloring is not the main event
Look at that neck
The message is immediate, the guy effs chicks
I spent a lot of years making friends with cool artists
So when they drew me tattoos I could truly feel important
Now some 22 year old inside a cube of brick and mortar
Got me questioning my morals and their corny pecking order
I should give a shit less
Cherry-No; Whip-Yes

Lotta years
Uh, lotta years

The girl that work down at the local juice place
Got a head full of dreadlocks down to her waist
I watched her add the spinach to the ginger to the grapes
My hair was underwhelming, my juice was fucking great
Some lady orders Maca
, compliments the locks
She asked how many years it took the girl to grow the crop
"It took a lot of years and then eventually I cut 'em, kept 'em
Reattach 'em anytime I want 'em"
My mind's fucking blown
The future is amazing, I feel so fucking old
I bet you clone your pets and ride a hover-board to work
I used a folding map to find the juice place in the first
These kids are running wild, I'm still recovering from church
You should have seen me in the 90s, I could ollie up a curb
You should have seen me in the 80s
I was bumping New Edition
, dragging acne into Hades
Count that for me
(One, two, one, two, three, four) Thanks
(One, two, one, two, three, four)
(One, two, one, two, three, four)
(One, two, one, two, three, four)

Well, any asshole with a book of matches can light a fire fresh;
Make that sucker burn for days, I'll be impressed
Surfing to bash the coach of bigot procreation baked in fanciful
Then scurry up the grass to roll his marbles off the anthill
I know girth and good nature but recognize absentee ballots
And sappy ballads couldn't fill the void
(No they can't)
It's James and the Giant Tugboat Complex and he's annoyed
(No one's asking you to build an ark brother)
Yeah, it's fashion
I'll find my own bullies to shake a finger at
Then realign mine eyes in divine justice
Plus this uncontrollable laugh
When those Amber Waves of Grain finally crash
Brimstone, cloned with legs and dim poems, 10 little Zen crafts
Things cooperate like paper doll participant litigants
Picket well around a burner style clinic
Acid for the basics, Ph-imbalance to burn the malice martyrs faceless
Then fabricate day trips
I wanna be the halo that jumps off the brain
Of the genius who decided some pictures deserve frames
(God and I are on first name basis)
Yeah I call him "God", he calls me "Jesus"
When I lost my religion, he fell to pieces
Blame. Dragon. Up hell's creek interrupting a devil pageant
Starfighter settle into madness
I keep my ghoul spirit concealed
Until The Warriors return to the Coney Isle Wonder Wheel
Come on

Born garbage day, warden of the shawarma plate
Fork a naked eye, and trade survival tips with tardigrades
Ephemera burning where the morning look like haunted marble cake
Parkas and pajama pants, I'm part of what don't march-in-place
I'm partial to the closest roving pack of gnashing gums
Smoking out the local protein, brokering the rabbit punch
I'm broken, fuck a focus group, fuck your folk, and Toto too
The produce of a pencil-neck who never met a social cue
Eye of the archfiend, appetite for alpha dogs
Step into the party with a killing jar and shadow box
Like "Who invited acid wash?", I'm shopping for the mantelpiece
Overkill is catalogued and crammed into banana leaves
Polaroids around him like a visit from the Vantablack
Miniatures in Biggie shirts and minutes that he can't get back
It isn't just gorillas in a camera trap, it triggers
The history pack a little aftermath in every image
Look

I should paint a eye on the front door
I should tell time by the sun more
I want a flaming arrow shot into a creeping raft
I'm kidding I just want the cheapest shit you people have
It's no thing

No displayed blazonry, unmistakably mutinous
The mood is disillusionment, shit, even Cindy Lou Who quit
I'm super stupid, future looking tuna fish and suture kit
In route to mute the TV and a view without a boot to lick
Bruised at the nucleus and drooling through the bells of war
Meet the neighbors when your resume is "skeleton-with-oar"
"Ummm, that's really cool your poodle made the paper"
Let's keep it at shoes in a elevator
He's a hat and coat, floating with no discernible visage
The villains turn to their homies who mostly turn into crickets
I'm part of a larger ghosting, I go to work with the wizards
Who already voted homecoming theme as a burning village
The damn shame campaign pivot when you in the field
Thinning blood and newly surfacing disorder, spin the wheel
Feeders out to slow the roll, reaper on the protocol
People you confide in will be spotted eating rodents whole

I should hang a skull on the side door
I should drink water from the sky more
I want a thousand lanterns drifting on a summers wind
I'm only joking, y'all can feed me to the fucking pigs
It's no thingThese lil', lil' fuckin' Martians
You gotta love em' though
Mars attacks wit' electric gats
Not for sapien abduction (what's up then?!)
Billy took a laser to the mug piece; hollowed out the mandible
Channel headquarters, order the cannonballs
(Mars attacksssss)
BFI demands column to this pigeon ankle
And boomeranging' our harvest;
51st area sickness
Not a threat, nary a witness won't injure the promise
Monster lead
-
carry your ligament fanged in the mosh pit
Dodge phaser
,
labor days are major A, sir
Cater the alien decomposer soldier platter like Caddy Shack eight
I told her "Go for C4 magic's"
Smolder as did Bazooka Tooth holster fabric
(This fucker's rabid and still breathing!) (Hiding cabbage!)
Oh, the heater claps to leave me
I'mma ninja this shit with sugar in the fuel tank of the saucer
Buddy up and head down to the metal corporate tunnels
Ice pick the soldered ship wiring; pissed off the mother and um
I'd be lying if I said I knew your intentions
See my sexy sabotage thinks defensive action'll save the race
You lend a hand on board to mention magma (Blaze the place!)
Spread fire of your revival, there's wires in your Bible
Obviously, ultra tech advanced when I point-counterpoint
Comparison of ET vs. little old freak me (She be on somethin')
Hey riddle sweet peas wit' your nickel PCs, fickle CDs, miserable TV sitcom (Typical!) Pathetic ritual collective slackership
Beautiful establishment; you ain't established shit! I consider you foul
Prowl back to the numbers under burnt pride in the dark (Sup, y'all!)
They want us dead or alive without the alive part!
The sun rose over a body bag shortage
Last week I was like "God bless the saint that invented the cordless."
This week I sorta re-routed of the bull's-eye of my worship:
Temple-body slash full cabinet master my diversions
Fuck y'all, lets do this shit;
My movement soothes any space invader practice
Stomped up to enemy like "Hey what now, bitch!?
I am human, hear me rise above material and cardinal sin."
They shot me in the face:
Mars wins. (Mars wins. Mars wins. Mars wins. Mars wins...)
(God morning, sir. May I show you something? Sir.)
(Jet-black smoke on the horizon.) Black smoke in the air
Maaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrsssss wins! (I thought you would like it.)
Who you screaming at dog? I got this! (Let's go.)
Zig zag 'zooka, pinnacle stitch
Unleash the unlimited edish primitive piss
I slip a cynical Mickey to most military ops
Monkey - here's how the filament drops
We on a pre-three prong ancient elephant tusk
Betamax fully
, break bread
You shruggin' it off, keep it electric, sure
But NY Electric's not about electric war
It's "hunt, gather", see the poor man's clan set bait
(Last page!)
Three, two, one, domesticate!
In the corner of the cave reinventing the wheel and roll out funny
Sitting on them Barney Rubble
twenties
, subtle;
Sipping saber tooth blood puddle
-
I could roll with the lackey's, that's if we hustle
Knuckle in the mud, hell's bells in the chuckle
Red-berried face means smudge around the muzzle
I'm allergic to the now-born solar panel cuddle
Stole cold to the core
, dirt menace
Stone cold sans Alcor cryogenics - stubborn
Can't talk shit with a tongue full of rug burn
Got bad cholesterol, good blood sugar;
Four-piece heartbeats wit' a subwoofer!
I'm not asking you to act like you notice (
Oh, Aesop's SO Mesozoic
.)
And now I see that cabinets pills be old (Potent!)
Open the mirrors
while I pulse with the voltage
Keeping me alive is the vibe with the Vulcan's hope!
Tangle the vine catapult (Catapult!)
I break it down to the bones of the crux with the goals of the age old
Eat. Sleep. Fuck
Structural droids; more bounce for the buck
But they want a last stegosaurs - thorns in its butt (buck wit' it!)
Prehistoric land shark business, cradled in the arms of the karma and kismet
Swarm to the sickly thawed out the glacier
Beggin' for the freezer burn; back every day, sir!
Sir, your science loves to fuck nature
Sir, your right to the dawn of my day, sir
Sir, your violent lab coat and beak can vivisect witches til we all catch vapors
(GIVE HIM)
Don't call it a sound-off, "Mars Attacks" be the malarkey downfall
(ONE)
It's not a game no more, run from the flash, leave your panic at the door
(THESE)
A lotta of magic gadgets, give em all back just to nullify the savage
(PILLS)
Mics crumble if we rock 'em right
In the year of the troglodyte
Saw a grey mouse gravy poured on a board
To the dull morose world like a lull in a storm
And I know you was hopin' that the piece for the ox was a dull sword, Ahk
Guess what: it's not! Guess what else: I transmit for the block!
T-Rex - X-Ray with triple X Hex (give it up!)
For the yesterdays, or the next I can assure you if there is I got the sword
(dead flesh!)
Alright, I can hear the ocean in a shell
But for the life of me I've never heard your surges more than raindrops in a well
Paladin tribe, break beat elitists, element five
Fully sold on operation, jeopardize of my survival
Will survive when sprayed by heaven's liquid ammunition
I'll survive when betrayed by my brethren's wicked ambitions
I'll survive when braided with shut eye; sticky thickets and thorns, born clutching a fistful
The hurt's morbidly blissful
Forms spiraling, sovereigns bring the rise in the funnel
A chorus line of blind crazes tap the water, find the tunnel (Find the tunnel)
As skinny click, mechanics flock to block pick of the land
We stretch the Earth around the canvas, drag a stick in the sand
And pan the hell out, timid, you're tireless, bold
The cold that ire spits clicks subtly on supremacy, therefore blemishe me
Oh, the treacherous penalty centers me, renders me bait
Skating slalom through this churning murder columns
I am not entirely trained to undo the shame
And all I got's three pennies and a rusty mic unto my name
Unto my game, defy the Siamese approaches
Whose delinquent dichotomy comps Emerald City in wondrous novelty
Drink drum, sip a snare to spit a rigid sequence, that's when freak sons
Fade to black just like these pretty pink lungs, slugger
Paper dolls' facade as swashbuckler (Yeah)
Bounty hunt the front to document the frosh cluster
I am structure with a smoke ring, militant distinction
With a cloak-and-dagger stagger prime directive
And all else burrows itself amongst drunken perspective, fade me
I flee the scene grippin' the missing link like chain gang escapees

Build me, kill me
We cadets hold determination as property, undeniably divine
We leak passion for the noise
There is not a track to cherish from he who lacks merit

And all I think about's the motion, exerted to color mavericks alerted
Herd a billion nervous lost child prodigies home to flourish (Yeah)
Now taciturn facets burn open to yield malarkey
Navigator when wrestled on fancy driftwood out the vessel
And I settle a conquest, stamp it, label it fresh (Fresh)
I in turn apply policies which require intrinsic merit (Uh)
Try to wallow down these yellow bricks with yesterday's appendix on hold
Spot it like sky horizon, posed as barcodes
Load your fantasy, interject a bad dream candidly
Blue in the face, through in the chase between myself and fame's embrace
Face engaging presence resonant with chiaroscuro atmospheric traps
Inhabit the land of denied clearance (Yeah)
Pigeonholed styles, drop similar, the course, the corpse patients
Lacing non sequiturs that spittle off the chin (Spittle off the chin)
Upon the recognition pilot soften up the grin
Spinning me dizzy, cold, bending my city to hold water
Yeah, we got affiliates, cadet merit and brilliance
Cleric apparel king-thing, crooked, I shrink, I sink into my book
It's like fury blew the scaffolding askew and tainted curiosities
Allow the freak show to continue
Forty thieves received the cue
, commence blending a planet
Decorate the dusk like henna to hand
We unknowingly sketched the pentagram by sending clans of caffeinated couriers
Upon a quest to run the perfect circle 'round a star
Bizarre pattern with a bad vibe like Jafar to Aladdin
Pardon the carbon-based blaze amongst the stagnant trend frenzy
It offends me; wait, ain't it the Liquid Soul therapy?
I sip to grip a stationary pillar, yet
We slipped these boogie nights, sucked wattage from rookie lights, now you proud
I'ma be there when you rush in just to touch the mushroom cloud
Drink failure, Lord have mercy on their dreams
Pretty pixels tend to trickle off the screen (Know what I mean?)
That's impossible
Come on

Spoilers, the non bon-voyage
Stock weaponry and soylents and whatever stop the voices
Colossal paranoias out to author an abrasive lore
About how war paint won't assure you ain't a painted whore, baby
No ground wires, all jaw froth
Mouth-breathing outliers climb out of mothballs
Wrung stones unsung and alone
Known to run up in the unknown, "honey I'm home"
I push a bucket of bolts, assorted death in his wake
I take the hand off the thief, I take the head off a snake
Approach a pen like revolution's just a sentence away
'Til then he's documenting cops and watching Heaven decay
It's not a gentleman's game it's a generation braced accordingly
Who know the differences between the cozy and the quarantine
Yes y'all the crestfallen careworn
Air horn, air horn, air horn, air horn

These awful winds
Those grinding gears
This pile of bones
That's why I'm here
Wild frontier
(Come on)
These violent drums
Those primal fears
This pool of mud
That's why I'm here
W-w-w-w-wild frontier

That's impossible, body still warm
Scavengers already obsessively knocking on his molecules
I'm catatonic, fat, and outta rocket-fuel and ramen
Not a dollar, watching Rocky 2 in Donatello boxers
At some hot-as-hell motel in what's supposed to be his Shangri-La
More akin to angry mobs with anchor tats and mangey dogs in vacant lots
Traded any semblance of consistency to play the odds
Not even a baby doll to change his gauze
Not even a hideaway to hide up in
A side effect of sliding environment to environment
Driving isn't simply when the tires spin, try again
Departures and arrivals aren't only time and mileage
Try again again, a raider break off from the phalanx
And never look back, never cook crack, K - thanks, bye
New York in the rear view then peel
Out, 'til he found New York in the windshield
Canteen, can of beans,
no compass
Add another bug to the goggles
Vigilante city watch, dipping through the gigawatts
Known for shaking sticks and playing chicken with the will of God
It's not a drill, it's a village aping a grid beyond the silicon
Same religion as Ram, Flynn, or Tron
Electric bomber jacket, jockey for the hottest lap
I fight a different system every time my throttle brap
In yonder shadows, every corner is a hostile act
Solid black helmet
,
track a bullet down the trolly tracks
When every tree up in your Eden reek of dog piss
You don't need a reason to Knievel any drawbridge
All in all, I'm all things lawless
Call the po', midnight marauder, no off switch
Only ever slow his roll to free a dove
Or autograph his own wanted poster, peace and love

I ain't think to leave a letter
Please don't cling to the vector
I don't blink first ever
I don't blink first ever
In sync with the specter
It's really not a thing you can measure
I don't blink first ever
I don't blink first ever

Dawn treader, green fog, Lincoln Log wrecker
Gloves all King Kong leather
Underdogs on machines blinking error
I seen hell and back, still pink in the center
Plinko off a punk and jump a cycle out the ecosphere
He don't wear a cape, but if he did, no one would think it's weird
Pinky swear that should I go exploding into springs and gears
You loot the rings and gear and ghost the scene without a single tear
I could hold a wheelie for a decade
Circle any borough like a bird around a headache
Mercury in retrograde
Mercenary working through the Jenga-scape
Body and the spirit going separate ways
Send a message back from the other side of the end of days
All it say is, "Catch me if you can, P.S., the weather's great"
What the fuck is resting on the seventh day?
I'm seven days of levee-breaking rain, stay the hell away
6AM and I'm dyin' for breakfast
Yawn and stretch then I'm diving for shellfish
Back up at the surface in a second or three
With a trophy Abalone from the depths of the sea
Water front critters in a symphony of sniggers
That's a pretty big meal for a pretty little dipper
How you gonna carry home all that food
I'ma kick back slow and point my toes at the moon
Cause

My Belly is a table
My Belly is a table
When I'm laying on my back
Snack plate upon my navel
Escargot, crab salad on a bagel
My Belly is a table
Say, say say what!?

6PM clam diggin all day
Big fat Belly like the grand buffet
You bobbin with the best back stroke on the river
Potlucks stretch from his throat to his liver
I'm never late for dinner, I make no reservations
All I do is pirouette into a den of celebration
With a delicate maneuver truth be told
My otter pop used to call it the sushi roll
You see...

My Belly is a table
My Belly is a table
When I'm laying on my back
Snack plate upon my navel
Crawdad, cocktail, prawns, basil
My Belly is a table
Say, say say what!?
Tech support, feral army
In a cave on a failed bit of terraforming
Four corners of paranormal
Get shorn for a thermos and pair of thermals
In the warehouse air where his dairy curdles
St. Vincent de Paul trying to square the circle
Circle the source of his power
Foresight born at the corner of Howard on sale
Cherry pick blue in the pale
It's a blue-nose chewin' his tail, losing his coat
Schmoozing a high and a head-rush
Hack up bile over H1N1, and then some
One eye on the breadcrumbs
Other eye on the Drencrom
Other other eye on the income
Good knife and a grin
Shoot dice with the lice and the ring worms
Peg leg, smells like Medellin
Wake in the night, make a pipe out of anything
Take 5, take a dive in the cellophane
Turn 5 into 5 6 7 8
Back out, black out somewhere fancy
Shaped like the backseat of Aesop's Camry, dude...
Seat full of chips and sandwich meat from the crypt
In the end if you give an address in a river of piss
Don't question the mystery fish
Just picture shrimp on a pillow of grits
Close your eyes, lick your lips
I'm at the cafe ordering a cup of fresh
Sara gave me 2, I gave one to Rex
He said, "Fools ain't shit plus fuck the pigs
They could never understand what Sumner is"

(Word up, word up, word up)
I'm off the grid
I'm through the gate
I fly these kites into the fray
(Word up, word up, word up)
I'm out the box
I'm through the mud
I fly these kites into the cut

NorCal fried bacteria
No ID survive the vivarium
Try soft wheels, sourdough and heroin
Eat with the chimera, fly with the seraphim
Might hold court with the cats and dogs
Who hold Kools like an orb in a dragon's claw
In terry cloth robes outside detox surly
Curse at a beat cop, doctor a Slurpee
Adopt no Xerxes, fear no moon man
Stay true like a wolf wearing wolf pants
Oooh, never could avoid himself
For long enough to contain or employ as help
And now he look both ways at the asteroid belt
Buzzed, gross and wholly unloved
Still hear an ex in his head yelling, "kiss the ring"
From a fortune to Fisher King
Or from assisted care, blisters in his hair
New day, new diary of disrepair
Soups on, 2-ton crucifix to bear
No shoes, no shirt, no fiscal year
I said hello to Marshall every morn for 6
He yelled at me every time, that's amore, bitch
It only took one tooth to crack the bug juice and chug
Turn a bum to a Sun Tzu,
it's bug
Outside home is an open swim
Occultism in the throes of corrosive wind
A cold meal with the ghosts of friends
A whole host of meds,
a deal on a Tone Loc cassette
I stepped over a body in the door
I pretend he asleep but it's probably more, God damn
Profound apathy, heart with a crack
I'm ships in the night, I'm darts at a map
Word up
New York
I could probably put some shit over the "New York" shit
Staten Isle
The Up-state, Tri-state, Universal
(Just for my people)
All day, NY, New York, Yeah, From NY, Long Isle, Bronx, Brooklyn, Up-town
Yeah, we're where it's at
Get down
In NY, we're where it's at in NY
Get down

I cut the ropes breathe
Fresh puddles of pigeon blood and smoke.  Load bazooka
Scoped the culprit hulks over a broken hookah
Got rebel camps with siphons amped to cookie-cut the wattage
Electric ilk NY raised on b-movie sluts and gossip
Conditioned the bodega rodent moment composure to echo numb and uncommon, dumb monkey pollen
My 23's lean over a cobra motor milligram bender
, novelty
I tip lids prior to clipping the comradery
Check the muck out
When metal maggots burrow in Promised Land vein division
I tug my brim down over my astigmatism, low pro
Paxil Rose, Axl broke and butchered
Last catapult standing in a land of coke and hookers
King Kong potluck
, no parking for rickshaw loads of sock puppets and sitcoms
Just Krylon pigs bred in a hot boxed wigwam
Serotonin deficient teens demonstrate ease in the modern day Uzi purchase
The foundation of their alacrity makes the mothers nervous
Me? Oh I check the newest murals to see whose still bombing this fucker and um respect
Find out what it means to me, New York
Walk blocks with electric ninjas who bark bounce for trunked out whips
Like, "My company DeLorean's the shit"
Skipper's out of happy pills again
He's in the neighbors garbage.  (Ahh Skippy)
He's making paper dolls decorated with targets  (Don't do it)
He's labeling the dolls with the names of shitty rap artists (Nooo)
Then tearing out the still-beating heart from the loose-leaf carcass
I ordered a hovercraft off the back page of an Archie comic
Built it in three days to float above snarky comments
My gills call the East River rock bottom home with three-eyed guppies and seahorse mutations
See, New York is ancient Rome.  Basic.  Basically stone.  Faces
My friend jumped off the Empire State Building while I hung with 10th grade head cases
"Some of them will blossom famous", some of them will blossom baseheads
But they all rep rivets in the die-cast metal Voltron cadence, what?
Yo, (Alright Ok)
Can I get a quarter or something?
Little hungry, you know what I'm saying? (Alright Ok)
Homeless...
I need a loosey, yo...
(Yo...)

Walk into the store with a pocket full of nickels
And a city full of horns, jackhammers, and rape-whistles
The alley cats manipulate the blocks with gutter magic
Today my heart beats only out of habit
Check it, it's like..
My man Jus used to keep an ox between his teeth
Said he could spit it with pinpoint accuracy if there was beef
We chuckled out loud
Still the thought of it intrigued me, (right)
So now I keep a jackal under my tongue to spit with related reasoning
The earthworm turbulent murder burnout Gerber baby no-brainer memoir stardom
Alarmed, pardon the old buzz deader
Robert Crumb ugly dumb image
Barely sprung fairly numb grimace
Nearly cut cherry blood spicket wrists back in high school (now it's like)
Slide, with a millipede pedagogue pirate
Navigates city sump systems, urbanite turbines, twisted Pistons,
Termites that infect sturdy grillage
There's roaches in the pillars, spillover
And crawl across commuter-clean wingtips and loafers
It's the theme park I built
Pocket full of nickels for cigarettes, gum, and milk
Bitterness, love, and violence
I'm writing a petition to have smoking as a sport
In the 2002 Summer Olympic Games (wanna sign it?)
Now look,
I jux' germs draggin a gavel knee deep in a maggot hatchery
Operation capture flag by any means
If this means anything at all, anyway it's a riddle
Walking to the store with a pocket full of nickels

Ay uh, yo excuse me (Ay Yo) yo
Can I borrow a dollar or something? (Ah sorry man) Nickel?
(Sorry man, I can't help you out dog) Quarter?
Something, man? (Yeah I only got enough for like cigarettes and shit man)
Alright man, I see how it is. (I'm straight)

Walk into the store with a pocket full of nickels
And a city full of World Trade Center victim candle vigils
There's anthrax in our mailboxes and Xanax in my tummy
There's a single Spanish female out west traveling the country
Freak of Fantasia leak laser major. Running bases
Neighborhood watch weasels pace in ugly acres more than often
If I ever make it big, I'm gonna build a skyscraper
Tall enough to piss on Cloud 9 egos from my corner office
You can't pull the plug on a catapult (nope)
I toss a nickel to a bum's cup from twenty paces thumbs up
Got twenty ways to tell you shut the fuck up
Nineteen of 'em are 24 bars long, the other one goes (SHUT THE FUCK UP!)
Animatronic daddy long legs stay grimy up in your zoning wall,
gobbling villagers trying to hide behind the windmill
I joust riding pig-back through subway tunnels with a third rail lance
While most still try to penetrate the alligator glance (It goes)
Back of the class, throwing pencils at professors
It made the Barbarellas giggle
That's when life's pleasures were simple
Now it takes a dancing bear jumping through flaming hoops
To even make em buy the god-forsaken single!
Thou shalt not desecrate the soothing spiral
Offered by a classic cut to vinyl
Find that in the Bible!
Miter saw militia fix ya up
How bout a pyramid shaped torso
With your hollow numbskull balancing on top
Now if you gotta rock a gas mask outside of your own apartment
You could pretty safely quote Shamar
Life's ill, sometimes life might kill
, sometimes prayers dwindle
Walking to the store with a pocket full of nickels
Day turns night, day turns night
Day turns night, day turns night
Day turns night, day turns night
Day turns night, day turns night
Night Light, sucka!!!

Put one up for shackle me not clean logic procreation
I did invent the wheel, in a previous generation
While the triple sixers' lassos keep
angels roped in the basement
I locate modern halos and pass 'em out to the cavemen
Y'all catch a 30-second flash frame
Dirty cooperative med platoon
Bloom,
head-trip split fantastic!
Fathom the splicing of major-league low-life
With anti-hero earthworm mentality - Godzilla!
I pace my game for zero-hour completion
See, a cretin's still a cretin, even speakin' altered moniker
American nightmare lost in the monitor
I'll hold the door open, so you can stagger through
Then send berserker-bred Jukies in after you
It's Gutter, and I spell it with the 'G' I stole from "Get the fuck up!"
Noise crutch stolen wretched refuse of my teeming dumb luck
Still I promise: temperance towards breed still bleeding Amish
See, the freaks sucked out the wattage
While three bears invade the cottage
And I can't sleep now! Yeah, the police'll laugh
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when you're hosted
By the ghost of Christmas past
You won't be laughing when your blow-up doll's got a headache and won't give up the ass
I'ma lay my kicks to rest when I'm impressed
So I staple-gun 'em to my feet
This origami dream is beautiful: pull the tail, watch the wings flap
But you really can't do a thing with that

All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Swallow up the pieces, spit 'em at your species
Beached in a city of lost barnacles and leeches
Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
(Day turns night)
Night Light, Day Light, Night Light, Day Light
Night Light, Day Light, Night Light, Day Light
Night Light, Day Light, Night Light, Day Light
Night Light, sucka!!!

I'm pretty sure I got a pulse
Plus we Shimmy cross the centerfold, and our night light engulfed
Just let me keep the crumbs (Please!)
With seven deadly stains, adhere the blame to crystal conscience
The result's a dead-beat tryin' to make a dollar off a bomb threat
Okay, link me to activism chain, activate wild-style Pluto orbit
Set a course, then push the button
I swallow spores born by the laws
Of a morbid glutton- Alley gospel
I can spot a duck battalion by the Charlie Chaplin waddle (gone)
Zig-zag and zig 'em again
Before the pig can pull a badge out for the lash out
Another thick installment of one night in Gotham
Like, "Houston, we have a problem:
they're buffing the trains the same day the graffiti writers bomb 'em!"
Who split holiday freaks on box-cut cinema high road bellow?
Head gripped, watch red bricks turn yellow!
I'm tryin' to meet the wizard, but a tailgating tin-man holding a oil can
won't let a hermit crab break in his new shell-toes
Life's not a bitch:
life is a beyotch
Who keeps the villagers circling the marketplace
Out searching for the g-spot
Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests
Or maybe you're just an asshole - maybe I'm just an asshole!
Kiss the speaker wire
Sammy Swashbuckler pagan threshhold
Stomach full of diner food,
wingspan cast black upon views
Here to help release the rabid hounds or pick apart your mood
I got this friend of polar nature, and it's all peace
You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast
Metal Captain,
this cat is askin' if I've seen his bit of lost passion
I told him: "Yeah," and gave him one last look and smashed him
For want of a nail the shoe was lost
For want of a shoe the horse was lost
For want of a horse the rider was lost
For want of a rider the battle was lost
For want of a battle the kingdom was lost
And all for the want of a horseshoe nail
There is a hole in front of the shovel
Shovel in front of the brawn
Six billion gorillas for whom the graves yawn
Each within his mulish days to choose his tool of trade
Dueling blades that cued a cruel charade and fuel the flames
Few would clue the crew into the civil
Skip the food and land like you the man
Who flew the coop over the pitbulls
Dash back flashy to compassionate nanopolice who sat beneath an avalanche of jagged inadequacies
And I was "Stop the Violence" more than I was Pontius Pilate
Cops and robbers riot by the five's obnoxious sirens
A is gullible he figure, "all man equal, no brainer"
Take it his friends and neighbors didn't cater
Moms raised the babies through a very churchy 80's
Sunday mornings reinforce the waiting gates of Hades
And he brazen but apparently inferno bound now
For when a man of cloth recite his wrongs he wouldn't bow down
The punishment should fit the reasons you must punish him
Never puncture skin or pull the colored rugs from under them
Two opposing mother ships shall not employ the gunners deck
Cause brotherhoods of public good do not employ the unctuous
And you. observe and have the givetheth disproportionate
To the taketh away
decide to maketh his day (do it)
All the stoic odium glow in a cold holster
To where he coulda stood easily in the tub jugglin toasters

No mountain too high
No city too far
No coma tonight
No city tomorrow
No fire too live
No city too charred
No treaty to sign
No city to guard
I picked the phone up with a grown-up mode approach
Skin crawlin off the drawl and now I claw the awkward tone up
I'd known it wasn't roses
But hoped it was less corrosive
Coastin to the focus of the grossest diagnosis
Like homes, the barnacles that chew upon the flesh of man
Have clued into the suitor was capital to a beggar's hand
And uncomfortably. sung a stubborn legacy of gluttony
With carnivores that burrow like hunters into the blood in meat - umm, what?
Chinny chin-up and the city picked this
In a pent-up letter numbed the spitting stigma
Along came a spider, sold her eggs to any buyer
Now to shoot a ringer back with six legs wider than the driver
If you make no friends on the way to the top rung
There is no secret handshake club I do not give a fuck
But know the cancers make the olive branches obviously standard
So when they extend from the yachts and mansions drop your canons
All kings hang em for the cliffs side drip dry
Will he clip the zipline or slip for his final dip dive?
If he live will he survive the milligrams of middle-ground
They pump into the pin-striped pentagrams over Tinsel-town
Or kill a man who trickled down the city with his scissors out
Or sickles, dipped in military hells bells and whistles
Riders to the east, not a wild tribes
Thank you for the peace on earth and mercy miles highBurn train buffers
My fancy
Up jumps the boogie delivering eye jammies
Walk through the muck with a clutch on a trident
Never give a fuck how far Pi went
You are dealing with a reborn icicle age poltergeist
Uprock, sidewalk cycles stuck at the bus stop
Wookie foot must not sleep
Under the invaders
No batteries
No jumper cables
Wired under-agers play box cutter face-lift
Rock utter makeshift spirit
To y'all I'm just a funny moniker with a couple of fresh records
And a bangin' hand style to put the jukies On the guest list
Walk for that
Metal train graf brainiac
Walk for them
Not a limelight
More to blush alizarin crimson
When the multi million
Tin men suck traditional rituals
Out the homes of starving children
And I bet they can see the city bleeding from the satellites
Formed by the corporate war drums recorded poorly
Dirty dub vamp
Bruised by the hues of wicked pallets
Chewed by the tooth of livid maggots
Dino DNA and cola, straight no chaser
Mars attacks colorfulness
I piss raptors on motherships
Hazy days will stay purple
Cause Cips with a Z bargain
Like Crazy Eddie commercials
Yo, ask her
Hey, Lucy, come here
Lucy, how old are you?
Lucy, come here
Lucy
Hey, Lucy, how old are you?
Lucy!

Lucy was 7 and wore a head of blue barrettes
City born, into this world with no knowledge and no regrets
Had a piece of yellow chalk with which she'd draw upon the street
The many faces of the various locals that she would meet
There was Joshua, age 10, bully of the block
Who always took her milk money at the morning bus stop
There was Mrs. Crabtree and her poodle
She always gave a wave and holler
On her weekly trip down to the bingo parlor
And she drew
Men, women, kids, sunsets, clouds
And she drew
Skyscrapers, fruit stands, cities, towns
Always said hello to passersby
They'd ask her why she passed her time
Attaching lines to concrete, but she would only smile
Now all the other children living in or near her building
Ran around like tyrants, soaking up the open fire hydrants
They would say
"Hey, little Lucy, wanna come jump double dutch?"
Lucy would pause, look, grin and say
"I'm busy, thank you much"
Well, well, one year passed
and believe it or not
She covered every last inch of the entire sidewalk
And she stopped-
"Lucy, after all this, you're just giving in today?"
She said:
"I'm not giving in, I'm finished," and walked away

1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed
A-B-C, that's the speed of the need
You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream
I'd rather live it, 'cause dreamers always chase but never get it
1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed
A-B-C, that's the speed of the need
You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream
I'd rather live it, 'cause dreamers always chase but never get it

Now Lucy was 37, and introverted somewhat
Basement apartment in the same building she grew up in
She traded in her blue barettes for long locks held up with a clip
Traded in her yellow chalk for charcoal sticks
And she drew
Little Bobby who would come to sweep the porch
And she drew
The mailman, delivered everyday at 4
Lucy had very little contact with the folks outside her cubicle day
But she found it suitable, and she liked it that way
She had a man now: Rico, similar, hermit
They would only see each other once or twice a week on purpose
They appreciated space and Rico was an artist too
So they'd connect on Saturdays to share the pictures that they drew
(Look!)
Now every month or so, she'd get a knock upon the front door
Just one of the neighbors
Acting nice although she was a strange girl, really
Say, "Lucy, wanna join me for some lunch?"
Lucy would smile and say "I'm busy, thank you much"
And they would make a weird face the second the door shut
And run and tell their friends how truly crazy Lucy was
And Lucy knew what people thought but didn't care
'Cause while they spread their rumors through the street
She'd paint another masterpiece
January, I fell to the cobblestone
In April, I cut little paper flowers
In August, I drank cold tea all my lonesome
In October, I was introduced as coward
I love New York Saturdays
But Mondays last longer
And since I plan to live a long life
Maybe I'll serve a thousand Mondays and swallow the burn
To merge the week for all its got
To give my shoddy rotten ribs (thick forgot my ribs)
I got a lil' something called a spirit crisis on my skull
And it's nothing short of ferocious but I swallowed the dosage
I got a mantle, and the mantle is a candle
And my candle is a flame that burns to symbolize the day Gretel met Hansel
Then I settle in a stand still
I live forever reaching for the sun
Hoping some lucky day I'll clutch and get a handful
Rope ladder, I'm a swinging anvil
And I wanna turn skullies and tummies with pretty lullaby, bye
The way my gypsy dances makes a monster retreat to fetal
I never felt so damn young
But you don't look a day over zero
And you don't look a day in its eyes cuz it'll make you realize
The night is near so
Well then go, dream, I clean around the edges
I tidy up the tabletop, and lectured all the pledges
I never really knew the true definition of precious
Till my angel wit the beautiful red locks gave me the message
I'm a fully animated life tree
See the root of the mute button was dug up bug up on a song
Of I'm a fully animated life tree
With branches for the heavens to admire naturally
Chorus 
Fame, war, love, honor, crime, innocence, tragedy, sunshine
Cringe, death, passion, heroism, God, suffering, joy, fate
Destiny, treasure, stars, gall, hunger, murder, silence, mayhem
Health, pain, suspense, breath, sound, guilt, pride, time

We all know what a halo is
But we all don't know the horrors if your halo tips
I be the matador making your pretty little heels click
I be the Sword in the Stone
of the contemporary eclipse
I'm incredibly exhausted
You can't imagine, got my warm spirit stuck in my teeth, I'm obsolete
Freedom freedom freedom fighter beginning
For the sake of better demeanor and such to bust, fucking fantastic
Every little step she takes breaks the chambers
In the chest, developed in the abomidable trouble
Settle for a cruel second, loud for an hour
Screamin to the beats to leave until my whole weekend turns sour
I ain't been around the world but I been around the block
I ain't seen everything but I seen enough to talk
I ain't a prophet, I ain't the Second Coming of Christ
I'm just a mason with a will to build and a little advice
I wanna weave a web, I bought a set of knitting needles
Fiddling with a theme, dream solid
Paddle in the hole-in-the-bottom dingy to where the portraits astonish
You won't regret a single solitary step, I promise
Look, in a situation where a dragon guards the gate
I make a true spur of the moment grown decision
Which in turn allows me to be something normal
With the prefix of the 'ab' and
I can kill every monster if I gotta, that's that
Rockin' it, rockin' it, clippership rockin' it
Be the little guinea pig, dig?
I'm tryin to make an exit with no ripples in the water
No splash, let the poison slide down down the hatch
It's like that
I'm- trust me, I'm- trust me, I'm trying to help
I'm- trust me, I'm- trust me, I'm trying to help

Flash that buttery gold
Jittery zeitgeist,
wither by the watering hole, what a patrol
What are we to Heart Huckabee, art fuckery suddenly
Not enough young in his lung for the water wings
Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch
Like, "I'ma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt"
Fine, sign of the time we elapse
When a primate climb up a spine and attach
Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isn't right
No score on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cow's actually beef
Blood turns wine when it leak for police
Like, "That's not a riot; it's a feast, let's eat!"

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass"
None shall pass, none shall pass

Now, if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz
'Cause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch
And express no regrets, though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss
To the jokers who pose by the glitz
Fine, sign of the swine in the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform
Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure out a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
True blue triumph is more
Like, "Wait, let it snake up out of the centerfold
Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready go"
Sat where the old, cardboard city folk
Swap tales with heads, like every other penny throw

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass"
None shall pass, none shall passFlash that buttery, gold
Jittery, zeitgeist, wither by the watering hole
What a patrol...
What are we to Heart Huckabee?
Art fuckery, suddenly?
Not enough young in his lung for the waterwings?

Like, "I'm a pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt."

Atop the news this evening...
This just in!
Thanks Bob!
Due to extreme technology advancements
I'm able to report to you live here
From what military officials are calling a "hot zone"
As you can see and hear, I'm right in the middle of the battlefield
Our Pentagon regulations asked us that we are, uh
To stay towards the uh, back of the unit
But, let me see if I can bring us a little closer
So you can see exactly what's going on

What'd I miss?
900 CC's of the raw in one fist
The bum's dumb blitzed
Order in the court where the mortars jump bricks
Everybody, lung on the table, this point counterpoint
Aesop has the murkiest, yet he numb out the prowler oint (uh)
And after bubblegum, he sink into the sofa
Clicker to pilot his broadcasted choice of cobra (hissssss)
The venom remains the same game of stale toxins
Camo'd with the now ornamental satellite options
Whatever's good I got this grave half dug (true)
With
Yani covering Taps to make the pain worse than it was
(nooo)
Playing marbles (playing marbles)
Hit by a bus (hit by a bus)
Death is sweet (death is sweet)
Hell sucks (sucker)
Damien probably wishing I'd donate a fuck
But this shit's chiller than any conversation I've had in months
The iron fang drew 'em all loopy (real loopy)
So when he extended a hand the planet's
Cujo's went Snoopy
In perfect syncopation,
burnt to crispy critters
Like synchronized swimmers in boric rivers
Mmmm, poor soaked critters
Lick chop dig-in, who dares lick a shot at pigeons?
Why I oughta... (Vast get em!)
He surfs city circuits for the power and the glory
To the cowards in the quarry you will always blink before me
Its Doc Roc full-effect, campfire stories
Like I "Threw Your Momma From the Train" to try to front on "Porkies"
He finds the garbage more inspiring than the good stuff (right)
His ink sleeps while the military look tough
Look, im sorry, crooked priority list
But Mr. USA-up-all-night's blackened heart already skips
I'm 'bout to crash this bitch to hibernate
Tell Wolf Blitzer holler at his boy when he hosts "Blind Date"
It goes spit on CNN and force the war back through the cable box
Where M1's are like stage props aimed at latest names dropped
So now he ignorant, right? (right)
No, he just accepts the inevitable apocalyptic syllabus
Sing along, Zooka dies of chemical poison, and watch 'em
Bring it on
Dag nabbit, that cat's bastard
I dead opinions and swap it out for the urges
Of a serpent trying to stuff it in the jam before the curtains
Deliver us from evil
Litter bugged amoeba simmer on the brimstone
Grim tone, bring him home
Authoritative restoration will be rationed righteously
To those deemed suitably fit to police their own sobriety
Standard law that wriggle intimate, mingle with coincidental mishap, then snap
Curse the digs
Yellow brick Zooka birthed the piss
I trust that every litigant will be his own worst pig
Thirst big, baby, I reckon y'all are a mess too, but insecurities will
Make your bio sound less cool
If fizzy lifting drinks are par for saddling your horse
You might consider sawing Sea Biscuit off at the knees before
Few chew sacred like them sewer cougars
Patient 'til the Lugar movers daytrip with them super cookers blazing
Divvy up the remarkable carcass, what a relief
And y'all ain't even washed yesterday's blood off your teeth
Behind the buck-bin Duane Reade aviators plated with the dookie brown tint sit
The googly off the daily paper
Clip red or blue (Blue!)
Either way the shredder chew
Letter to the editor messenger, let him through

Engine engine number nine, sock it to me one more time
Said uh,
un-gowa, we got the power
Said uh,
un-gowa, we got the power
Said uh,
un-gowa, we got the power
Automatic systematic engine number nine, sock it to me one more time
Said un-gowa we got the power
Okay, do your thing
Family, do your thing, do your thing, stop

I put a beetle on his back and take notes
Play a dealt hand.
Kicks wing tips 'til the tank flips conveyor belt
Shelf a mayor saber for catering navy savior
Help who treat stray children like clay pigeons off the sailor's deck
He squeaks 'pull', I freak the wool over the owl eye;
Filter sheepish winter through its sister on the outside
Meanwhile back at HQ, he's twisting his moustache, hatching a plan to hate you
Shark fin dollar pay a ghost guild buckets
Hard pill to swallow and he knows pills, trust him
Drunkards of the crystal palace suck assignment
Walk the diamonds in the soles of your chukkas back to the slaves who mined 'em
It's Raggedy Andy clan; fancy the pretty stitches
'til he learned the skinny on the fragility's physics
Like he snag a button eye on the fly by the barbs
Super glue the parts, now his students are alarmed
No worries, it's snow flurries compared to what the sheriff wish:
Curfew the city that must not
Bust warn shots at a run-of-mill Waldo on a doctor hunt
He will make the most wonderful sarcophagus occupantShh...
(Well or, and this is, New York City)
Where the shiftiest sources leak out the back door
For more and this is New York City
(Oh, I see these hear walk
I, simply a shade of shepherd
Seems we share fate, honestly)
Oh, now wait a minute
I notice there making mockeries of mad men
Tend not to bend in the honesty
My twenty thousand leagues ending grants sardonic fatigue
(The view from this here segue crowds a listeners nothing special simply
Listeners, how we dissolve its spores and I'll tell you not flying)
And I live beneath the scenic yeah, where the fossils pledged allegiance
Where the centipedes and serpents bigot on territorial disagreements
The uprooted turned moody and hacked pleasure to skinny ribbons and I'll
Suckle my skull caught beneath assumptions pumping pistons
(Left the joke to wick, it
He walks whose out now, we, Aesop walls up)
We tune out the pouts of hiding
Twilight street merchants, we, deity freely and been here before...
Murder, of holy, in cushion
Partisan, part of the ceiling seems to be leaking, oh, oh, it's the wall
Forbid box been broken, from man of everywhere, that's what I sleep, I love you
It's not easy tying knots, whose paycheck may get rained
Outstanding I shall smudge, invest, it's dull here, since we need I go beyond
Grey, lonely, this forest is very very different
Friend hail things like magnets all the way meant was (It only takes one slacker)
Traveling up, it only takes one slacker

It only takes one slacker, to attack alacrity and compliance with time
With regulations poachers poaching just to jump the batteries
I'm juiced, noosed by the notice, seduced by the ambiance, the motives, and the modus operandi's
I'm supportive, sort of here to modify those monsters
Tried to side wind pleasure captains round my hip line
My sit times on some here I lay my bricks alone to build these walls among
Us dreams can spread our spores
but can I run with the alumnus fungus
After date rape, and it germs,
and I burn for less fortunate starlight
Chasers forced to use there last match to ward off the glaciers
Pack a day profess cloud spitter, literate pacifist missed the pissed drunk of concert
Dull and system missed the funk I'm in a lull
I'm thinking of a number from one to red, is a beautiful color
To shade paper hat ink, I'm thinking of a beautiful color...
Paper hat
Yeah, stirring up the pot
Add a couple worms, herbs from the swamp
Conjure up a curse, turn a person to a frog
Courtesy the blob with the shirt full of snot
Plus mildew
Pretty much a ball of sticky stuff and soft tissue
Hemoglobin, cat hair, peanut butter, coffee
Born with a cough and a finger in the frosting
I can't stop sweating
People at the store say, "I think that man's melting"
The fan's not helping
It's probably a job for Abraham Van Helsing
I woke up on fire and speaking a dead language backwards
Several octaves deeper than his average
The how is not important, it's the translation that matters
It says, "Beware the flesh in which archaic evils gathers", goddamn

I slosh when I move, mop not a broom, my body ate my shoes
Mold on his robe, moles on moles, I don't have any bones
Retreats from the sun, bleeds from his gums, I sleep in the tub
Fever and a cold, teeth in many rows, I'll eat a whole goat

Earlier this morning, several hunters from the region
Put a BOLO on his spirit, call the number if you see it
Container at the bungalow, bubbling at the gumline
The bushy-tailed and bug-eyed, come in every color fungi
Oh fudge, my new form isn't in the folklore
The new norm wasn't in the brochure
There's no known cure
Nothing more to figure out, just sit around and grow horns
Germs on germs on germs
Slide through, cry you a river of soft serve
My snail trail exhibit infinity wrong turns
I'm gelatin, forever in line for the hors d'oeuvres
Coat full of crab toast, foam at the whistle
Future of a puddle with a phone in the middle
With no signal
It's emotional

I slosh when I move, mop not a broom, my body ate my shoes
Mold on his robe, moles on moles, I don't have any bones
Retreats from the sun, bleeds from his gums, I sleep in the tub
Fever and a cold, teeth in many rows, I'll eat a whole goat
I start my city with a brick (one brick)
Then add another brick (two bricks)
Brick by brick I manufacture homes for fallen angels
I ain't no great Samaritan, that's just the way the game goes
Respect the polars but acknowledge middle-value rainbows
My snout turned up from dream factory eyelids
Slinging bottled prosperity for the kamikaze colonels
Yeah rocks the match that burned his Nazi journals
And plotting verticals amidst blatantly horizontal
Models then swallowed by famished potholes
And I'm tired, tied up on these functions
Killer cotton candy clouds and huckleberry justice league
Another knuckle dragger dungeon breed
Run, breathe, sit, bellow
Wild Aes scream through your style to hear the echo
Aight then, flinch for the great granddaddy payback
When Little Billy bought a tugboat
Now he thinks he's Captain Ahab
Fascist, it takes more than peg legs, birds and eye patches
Learn that lesson you'll be swashbuckling with the best of them
Wonder why you wept over spilled milk and got your crayons wet
The room reeks of a thousand bayonets
I'll fission vision with a lie longer than your most walked meridian
Connecting life with that little species of idiots
We've now officially scraped barrel bottom
Aesop Rock, an apple to the core but y'all ignored him
I know a planet made of porcelain
And once I get tired of holding this gavel up
Y'all prayer circles met him up born again
I ain't too good for tap water
Play taps out of order for a ballad, corpse a dead man walking
You can lead a man to a city, but that don't assure civility
You can beat a man to death with Aesop Rock bootleg CD's
(That's more fun anyway)
Some cats float, some cats don't
I speak in Fahrenheit and burn off coal and lyric
Diss blatant harassment, spit honor, whistle fearless
Don't dismiss the billy goat appearance for that common sheep


Platforms have been erected
Effigies built
Slogans coined, songs have been written
Rumors have been circulated
Autographs faked
The hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape
Moving boxes have been worn out
Mantelpieces dusted
Idols idolized, the sands have been shifted
Curtains have been closed
Sleepers all waked
The hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape

Now with my trusty paperclip
I pick locks of thoughts vault
Finding the garden barren
The harvest fruitless
Only the tree of life flourishing
Wanting to take a bite but I'm toothless
Is that predestination or is it by design?
That I'm trapped in time sand
Show radio mission control but for my rhymes
Man because I can like aluminium
And I recycle my consciousness
This is just a note
For any action or lack thereof there's a consequence1 of 4...
My name is Ian Mathias Bavitz
I was born in one-nine-seven-six, at Syosset hospital
Located in Long Island, NY
I am six foot, four. I weigh two-zero-zero pounds
I have brown hair, and green eyes
I enjoy writing songs, painting, movies, and diner food
I have two brothers, Chris and Graham
And two parents, Paul and Damita
In August of two-zero-zero-one, I went crazy...
This was originally not for public consumption
This was made for four people...
Four people that literally saved my life
They know who they are...
And uh, I mean I could live to be a thousand years old and never repay them
I don't think this song would pay for them
But hopefully by putting it out
It'll push the thank you a little further...
This ain't a burner for the whips. (No, it isn't)
This ain't even Aesop Rock fly earthworm demeanor. (No, it isn't)
My name is Ian Mathias Bavitz, and I was born in Long Island, New York, seventy-six
Before Graham and after Chris... OK
In August of two thousand one, my seemingly splinter-proof brain bone-scaffolding imploded
I kept it on the hush, but nearly tumbling
To the cold hard concrete on mere bodega trips
For cigarettes and soda, shook me to Casper
Dizzy with an argent chaser, motor sensory eraser
Agoraphobe tunnel-vision, guilt, self-loathing arrangement
Rose rapidly out a bog I'd never fished in
That abates three separate foreign meds
While I was used to hook-line-and-sinker-simple fission
Simple, primitive, self-taught easing of soul, mind and body
But the symptoms rejected my caveman Modus Operandi
So now it's one fish, belly up, through medicated mileage
And shrinks that get $250 an hour for awkward silence
And, I'd be lying if I said all of this
Made even the slightest fragment of sense to me
That's real... Simply put
I don't know what happened, or what's still happening
I literally feel like I'm teetering on the blunt edge of my sanity
One of four
My name is Ian Mathias Bavitz. I was born in 1-9-7-6, at Syosset hospital, located in Long Island, NY. I am 6 foot 4, I weigh 2-0-0 pounds. I have brown hair and green eyes.

I don't know what happened, or what's still happening
I literally feel like I'm teetering on the blunt edge of my sanity
JAIME
,
I killed the robots and I'm sorry
Broke down in front of you, embarrassed
But you lent a heart and hand that only you could
You're one of my best friends and yes I'd take that bullet for you
That's my word, which is about all I have left
TONY
, I know you know I'm crazy, cause you told me
But that didn't ever bother you, I hold you as my brother 'til death
And I got your back if ever the drunk goblin step
For makin' a cat laugh when I was walking with the dead
KATHRYN
, mother figure, older sister, concerned beyond limits
Letting me know I wasn't the only one with this
Continuous offers for vacation,
Chicago visits
Talked me through repair of a head full of broken pistons
RAIA,
for the late night movie rentals and the company I needed
An' you knew it, but I just wouldn't admit it
You listened to me blab about my issues for hours
Offer incredible advice, gave me a hug when I was finished
Am I a jack of all trades? No... I like to write songs though
Are they good? I dunno...
But I could tell you that I only write shit down when I believe it
So take this how you want, but know I mean it
I want you all to know that I'm scared
Now my fuckin' crooked soul never faced a monster like the last few months
Ever in my whole life..
. I wish I could explain this better (I can't)
But the pieces won't formulate it to anything even close to cohesive
So I guess this is my feeble way to thank you
Four soldiers that extended something sacred off the purity of kindness
I owe you all my life and please don't argue with that statement
'Cause without y'all, I may not have a life to offer, take it

Thank you
I wish I could explain this better (Thank you)
I'm sorry for burdening your pleasures (Thank you)
I love you all with all that's left of me (Thank you)
For helping try to kill what made a mess of me (Thank you)
Somehow, someway (Thank you)
I'mma get you back someday (Thank you)
Just gotta figure this all out (Thank you) So;

I guess it is kind of funny when you look at it from a step back. How one man can literally buckle under the same pressures other men operate normally under. I have scoped this out from all angles, multiple times. I have been over everything in my head, till I can't think anymore. But I guess some times, when you can't breathe, there are people there to breathe for you. I am lucky enough to have those people around me. Thank you for helping me to not die. Thank you for helping me to not die

Pocket full of pennies, and a soul gone tilt
Cockpit full of memories and a drain full of guilt
Pocket full of pennies, and a soul gone tilt
Cockpit full of memories and a drain full of guilt
Pocket full of pennies, and a soul gone tilt
Cockpit full of memories and a drain full of guilt
Pocket full of pennies, and a soul gone tilt
Cockpit full of memories and a drain full of guilt
I'm twice born,
once in 7-something
Once as the resurrection of honorable function
Been shoveling coal as the engine's doctor
Long enough to see my silhouette acquire a permanent kink in the posture
The maintenance of icicle spirit by the warmth of true endearment
Was, is, and forever will be a luxury
I'm a sovereignty columnist fathering doom document
Curséd version of a certain Virgin Mary womb occupant

(
Oh my Lord, what have I gotten myself into?
Seems like I woke up in yesterday again
Another day, another dream)

I know swamp rats who never suckled oxygen purification
Sure as blurry mayhem had 'em spent
(Zen freeze)
Stuck until my friend leaves,
puppet for the plummet committee
Sputtering bum, numb enough to stomach the city
Who's that hugging the silhouetted willows where the hill's crest pan out?
Barter candy-coated crab apples and sugar-dipped death hand outs
I got a plan, I'll tourniquet my quest
Then feed a needle in the bad ending to mute the mess
When patience gallops with absentee ballots, I shove in the button
Strutting to exhibit mankind's hostility function with a (heave)
Paling in comparison to Matthias, Goliath
Lies the rickety frame of the wicked silence
I died the day my nameless creator and I bumped eyelids
Swear to Christ we saw the same thing for a second (What's that?)
The grand mosaic depicting historical glory of the legend
Nursed me through the time stick-and-stone mixers hexed my fertile crescent
Now all's well, I'm laughing on the inside I swear
Just trying to keep my head above red tide despair
My imperfections pair off with buddy system symmetrics morbidly
So every second of discontent's logged accordingly
Now let's turn mummy subtle perfection to preserve glory condition
And pray for the day a starchild tugs the ribbon
Better land a two-hand grip on that spoonful-of-sugar medical chaser
Credible crazer antidote's terrible, taste her
Barter with a Stolen Soul Peddler, pigeon backed feather pen
Never said a grin implied health
Consider me a mobile advertisement for that hybrid blend of fabrics I deemed practical
Now is you is or is you ain't compatible?
I feel the wind in my opinions
Plus hyper clutched to crush one's gingerbread tenement awful
It's like the day the great oak met the sawmill
A lifeline of spectacular expansion meets the reaper at the hand of one man's tantrums
My friend's got a book about dreams. I look and laugh
I dreamed a book about my friends and still can't decipher the half
Chatterbox. Now let a soothsayer major cater to a kinked breed
Battered on the brink of disease
(Well)
I am (skin and bones), I am (sin and poems)
,
I am (tin and chrome)
Grin and groans, fuck it, I'm tinted quinacridone
Blow the petals off a dandelion trying to make my little gypsy blush
And felt as if I'd actually accomplished something
Fortify the bullies, let a joke soak in the treatment
Sit and watch the percentages teeter on the evening
Caught a ghost up in the fuselage seconds before the cog dropped to the sticks
And stared him down until he fixed it
Ay
Whats this fuckin' guy doing?
What are you doing?
Right now, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Yuh
Yes sir (Yep)
Put change sh-put change in his cup
(Oh can you play it wi-with the other guitar)
Weatherman
(I like this one )
What's that weirdo with the fucking kazoo?
Ay

Sharks in the dunk tank, vipers in the garden
Locusts stole the groceries out the local Farmer's Market
All God's critters hold positions
Some are violent, some are victims
Each alive is an equal and vital piston I support
So when the piranhas honor New York
My daddy long legs dangled and mangled for sport
And while I bring in every dink in the kingdom with open wings
It all boils down to them shit-soaked pigs
The pigs (what), the pigs (what),
the dregs of what y'all aim for
The gluttonous muddy stomachs under the pudgy cakehole
Two-track
braniac using the food and payroll
To chew up and consume every cookie, crumb, and peso
And place a cloven hoof on the lucrative when convenient
As the bourbon-odor smokers' coughs smolder off the Cohiba
If Noah had the benefit of hindsight on his ship
He could've snatched two unicorns and left behind the motherfucking...

Pigs!
God damn... pigs!
Potbelly... pigs!
Punch-drunk... pigs!
Take money, money... pigs!
Loudmouth... pigs!
Wide load... pigs!
Let's make a deal...

When all the wolves in woolly wigs
Have huffed, and puffed, and blew the bricks
The skulls of Brooklyn's cruelest pigs
Will rain on Fulton's newest kicks
As mulish swine of all surrounding counties sniff the gruesomeness
We pass around the pineapples and pull the pins in unison
I will gladly feed you to the breed who wants you sacrificed
No pagan or sacrilege, just bacon for scavengers
I will gladly seat you with the chickens, not the passengers
Hopefully the crack in his armor spreads to his avarice
Never that, Wilburs multiply quicker than triples
And hunt their truffles in fistfuls, but it was all bells and whistles
Bougie this and Bougie that...
War pig or pussy cat...
Glitzy to the pork ribs, had to gold-leaf the booby traps
Powder-pink, double-breasted, mess of mud and money
Waddle off the fire to make his stubborn tummy wroggle
And while I don't really know the working details of your tribes
I know that that's one ugly fucking tie
Keep it classy
Key to Pizza Alley
Weaving traffic in a overheating taxi
In Lima
Tickets to liberate the center, pitch surrender
To a witch doctor pouring amphibians out the blender
Underneath a glowing purple Christ
Perfect surf, curl up and die
Cobblestone alone a masterclass in open world design
I came from the wasteland in featherlight trail pants
Fugee off the ant trail
Inca trail mailman
Fail in every hemisphere
Show me the ambrosia
Maybe ghost into the coca leaf and holy heliconia
Where shaman opt to zombify undocumented expats
High and writing Ayahuasca letters back to Melmac
Dear friends
Send help yesterday
Yours true, condor, puma, serpiente
Talk rap albums over alpaca medallions
With metalheads who traffic magic flowers from the mountains
To the houses of the holy
A token of that sacred valley balance
So you don't expel omega fatty acids
The strays in the plaza look happier than my neighbors
They answer to Paddington Bear in waders
It's amazers
What ship, what shore?
I grew up writing riddles under bridges in New York
Now I travel like a highwayman who whispers to his horse
Sharing stories out of winter, trying to trigger something pure
From "Dying on the vine," to, "It's alive and indivisible"
To, "How'd I get this far without a bindle full of crystal skulls?"
Cozy local woven goods
Beaded shit for people you have never met or spoken to
But know they'll need to hold Peru
Throw a couple logs on the fire
There's a chimney in San Blas where you can hear Baby Dayliner
Bouncing softly off the navy blue
April showers, paper moon
Run the light and beat the drum
And smoke the dope and raid the tomb

Pay no mind to the bygones
Find him a strange hill to die on
Never let me die on a regular hill
Never let me die on a regular hill
Pay no mind to the bygones
Find him a strange hill to die on
Never let me die on a regular hill
Never let me die on a regular hill
Never let me die on a regular hill
Never let me die on a regular hill
Never let me die on a regular hill
Never let me die on a regular hill

The local homie blow smoke on his wounds
And talk about the jungle like it's always in the room
New and shooting lumens out of a canoe into the ruins
Silly putty for some otherworldly woo-woo to influence
Ooh, it's a strange bouquet
Not today, Supay
Rubber boots and tumbo juice and tarantula toupee
Canopy going H.A.M. over camp in a feuding biome
Os Mutantes row-row-rowing the wrong way into the diode
Fry the banana, heart of palm ribbons
Fish from the river, sauces made of citrus
On a screen porch pimpled after dark with frogs and lizards
When high as hell, they might as well be Mothras and Godzillas
It's awesome
Peer into the spirit quest, spellbound
Three to one machete, yelling back into the hellmouth
You hit the labyrinth an ambassador of peace and love
You might return with the root of your superego plunged
Style messiah, Hot like a volcano with fire

The sound of silence vers' the sound of War
Echo death shock-renegade
Crooked cynic tyrant
Your ignorant bias is my Goliath
Starving alliance seeps under the skin
The seven deadly sins
That's the seven elements of the malevolent
The relevance of
Graphic endeavors
Drastic measures took for defense
My secrets unfold codes of conduct, raid
Blade runner, intimidating
Figment in the minds of the malignant
Your opinion: not significant, bludgeon
Poetic potential draws dotted lines between hunter and hunted
Liquefied thoughts seep through the cracks in side-walks
Lieutenant cynic consist of anonymous all this seems famished
Vanished in gritty streets til' city seeks, sleep, head, rush
Scope, infra-red touched
Temple's the torment
Pressure point contact
Crush the dormant with missing links
Syncopate movement, Our trobbled blockade ends but I'm blemished in the blueprint
Behold of the hideous
Some assaulted by the anthems of the lesser
Concerned, I squinted through tinted pains of pressure
Transcend, backlash, jet black ink bleeds to breath abstract interpose passages
Database entries slip through the fingers, you're forgotten
A faceless figure shall put among an infinite citizens capital coward branded in the backbones of the stranded
Ese's hunger for upper handed plan strategy: strike force
Pays quicken upon asphalt light source sun burst beams
A portrait of pillage
Multiple put-downs paint burn marks on perception
Indulge indefinite challenging chapters never before have human eyes looked upon
The unbearable weight
Contaminate little thieves
Heaves, breath, the last gasp
And I last grasp, but trace through your trickery, pinpointed
Technique cast on the fresh but it's now thickly anointed, vicious cycle
Ya'll spinnin if you tread before you think
The center of my web is pen and ink
It's the merciless, masquerade merging separate flows of music's martyrs
Threw my flag into the ground and claimed your land for starving artists
The masquerade merging separate flows of music's martyrs
Threw my flag into the ground and claimed your land for starving artists

Style messiah, Hot like a volcano with fire (repeated x14)

Dear Colleague
I am so very sorry that my son has made such an exhibition of himself with your daughter
It really does seem quite out of character
Although I have to admit it is quite funny
Of course he's really got into trouble with his supervisor
But I'm afraid he's only got himself to blame
It really...

All I see is little plastic soldiers with little plastic holsters
Spit on plastic cultures belittled by sarcastic vulture swarms
Warning I'd skip your stepping stones down by the sea shore
It's that scarlet welcome carpet that I fiend for
My dreams spore schemes each more malicious than the pre-ceding
Red skies bleeding acid this is best inspired by your doubt
All through flood fire and drowning all tied rapidy into humid winds
Lucid lens bend vigil spectrum's drippin' shades of rays, I prayed for days lacking discoloring (????)
Bigots may seems to scare me I dissect voids my friend drawin' cranes with metal flanks (????)
Walkers cross Battle-stars I travel far my radar flips
Eye of the storm following scraping my backbone
I try to spring clones leaving em like tendrils, that require
More than a click-click five
While figments of malignant spine pleasuring quick to pigment puddles
Gathered in gutters
Type B-negative whirlpool
I swarm fool like you, poetically puncture
As still in dreams while empires fall apart
He a cyborg killing machine with wires in his heart
I'll never know of you
Emotion reads close encounters I run
The last classic example of a love of mic and sample
Trampled pride resurrected with ample improvement motor movement mandatory
Not a question of should I
But I passively consumed the role casted by masters of supreme sources
Crafted by supreme forces
Seemingly dream catcher
Aesop Rock computer Hacker!
See you lack a dispatch to request back up
Collapsing scaffold mad pole crusher russian robot recruits
We shoot starving artists 'de trops' and intrude
I am waterfall
I'm excluding inaudible slaughter calls
Venomous survey calibrating mics for lurkin'
This is not good

Bat shit, I'm bat shit, my ships crash, my zag zig
I'm all whiplash in that black tint, black ash on my flag pin
I go zip zap and y'all back spin, y'all spacecrafts call mayday
I like tailspins when they back lit and cats scrambling for that safe space
He plays defense around dead zones, next up to cold explode
Rest up, I go death punch, it rains F'd up UFOs
I throw episodes in all star maps that get veterans to bring barf bags
It bring hellfire and little party hats for those parting ways with they tarmac
Blast off and get waxed off, these saboteurs are like pack dogs
I might shoo 'em off and they boomerang, line 'em up and illuminate
It goes ooh and ah and you too late, we got a failure to communicate
In my rearview's a little planet Earth and my calendar is straight doomsdays
Fuel up and I steamroll, you better moonwalk when that screen scroll
I feed castaways to these gamma rays and my handshake is all sleeper hold
Ease in and get heave-hoed with no easy mode and no foul play
Bounty hunters get found out, power up or get outpaced

Ease awake at 3 AM
He found freedom in the mayhem, amen, amen
Give me a lost world to locate
Get ghost with folk who don't obey, okay, okay (
You're almost out of time
)

Time is not being a good friend, smoke is being a good bookend
I'm no joke, I only go full send, don't poke at the pure bred bullhead
Dog fights that call for old fight songs,
start crossing names off the flight log
Might light cigars off the fire ball, we are well past any kind of dialog
Warfare, I don't war fair, I like rocket fuel in my morning air
I like red buttons under iron fists and my stunt doubles like, "I quit"
The kid three-sixty all side-eye and pluck wild geese from that twilight
I go hyperspeed and can't drive for shit, I just bob and weave when y'all skydive
Lights blink and my screens glitch, if I lose it all, I ain't need the shit
I call "Bombs away", it turn mobs away, you're all, "Die alone," I'm all, "Not today"
We go eye for eye around pale moons, fighter pilots find Jesus
I don't tread soft with that special sauce, see you was better off in some mail room
Dumb luck and no late pass, I get gussied up and I gate crash
I'm playing laser tag in plain stupid odds, tag my name on they fuselage
Outlier in the main event, I keep downsizing y'all's data set
Infiltrators get checkmate, it's maybe best to just play dead

Ease awake at 3 AM
He found freedom in the mayhem, amen, amen
Safe and sound out the crash site
Life forms that refuse to flatline, that's right, that's right (
You don't even care do you?
)
Yeah... riff raff...
Uh, Weathermen, Hieroglyphics, what up? Ok

Riff raff, alley, when I boom slang, drip draft
Venom with a new twang, same swagger, new thang
Whose gang, a stagger with similar dirty worms
Who occasionally cluster up the surface and observe
A.R. periscope, blast through the terror dome
Zoo wanna shark attack, clash til the thrill is gone
Bark back, fresh off the pharmacy, counter doubter pop
Blame it on the overly aggy farming of power crops
Dark wing when I pioneer deer, croppin' the odds
With all the proper sprockets and cogs
I bounce with a seventh sin, equipped with a foul jowl moment
Waiting for that great celebrity towel throwing

And you niggas know what time it is, it's preservation
The national guard, it's me and Aesop
Rock, stopping any operations against the fence
Del is quick to dispense, with foreign elements
Back, y'all the anchor attribute to the decay
Strives who plays, map your route, cause Aesop is absolute
Del? He practice shoot, basket hoops, capture fools with lasso loops
Hip hop needs two veterans such as us, who ain't never scared
To tear it there, hard to tell, vegetarian and aware of it
Therefore, Teren can take care of it, ok, ok

I bang on doors, pay rent, lamp and divert complaints
Grip clicker, make rap music during commercial breaks
Darwin Galapagos Island, evolution mutant
Through the one man species, shaking leaches off his Puma's
Beach run ashore, on whores, and contaminated play
Sprout try'nna out the older alligator fade away
Make his day, please, I chisel the missile gently
Blast when the waggin' little finger condescends me
Green Earth bum, walk a rank plank, feet first plunge
Like Del keep the rugged Bay under his thumb
Aes' hid the drum, keep paint under his lung, ugly
Proof an old dog learns more than a runty puppy
Sulking in bulk and a half, sulk in a laugh, crash test
Figure the mixture's digging up his last breath
Grief leaf thief briefly turned chieftain
The tap water is on the waters off the waters leaking
So this is blue?
My frame reportedly sparred in garden variety burners and lost to normalcy
My terms the memoir, obligation the bookmark
Crystallize impurities to zero on the...
Autocrat derby catapult sponges, my hunches hurling murder abundance
Lunches where the city sump is pungent, (Curdling!)
Tomorrow sits on what the sin/consquence merger brings
To bubble up along the edges of precious child fantasy broken, broken
Hi, my name is Hazardous Tobacconist
(Hi),
hung on the brink
I purge a dirge and spit my lung in the sink
As for the product, well it's wrenched in a barren backward wasteland
Of shimmering moral tension
adventuring to blossom pleasant
I've done it all, from pixie dust to cramming pins in voodoo dolls
And ninety-nine dreams linked on the shooting gallery wall
But it's like, not a wave crash similar to last or next
Heckle me not already doctored by regrets
Rain (rain)
Belligerent fragments bond massive
Usher in the pixels 'til the image burn classic
Bliss in a barrel and motivation in a basket
Imma cast it out to sea and wait for my karma to grasp it
I left my crutch over the rainbow with my riches
And I know the rat race of the bad taste once its grimace cringes
See, an iron butterfly will float if given good condition
But I'm still fishing the same worm from the same faulty position
(Prosperity)
Sorta makes you think
I'm a Tomahawk I walk alone and miss the bliss
Inside the accidental meeting of the pencil and the seedling
And the central started beating
Breathing at a rapid caliber
I doubt if her allotted grace will last forever more
-
Dusting off a dream to be an autopilot
Still a silent understudy.
Funny how the opposite will throttle
And the different stroke and model to the prison
Is an accurate portrayal of inadequate betrayal of a wish
-
Gonna-wanna-coulda-shoulda-woulda didn't
Isn't it amusing choosing
Yet a plan is hibernating
Waiting till the mating dance of motivation took a fine position
Dishing only after every little kiddy has performed
-
I just wanna be a general he said
I just wanna, I just wanna be a general he said
I just wanna, I just wanna be a general he said
I just wanna, I just wanna be a-
I just wanna sleep, yoI saw them, they're out there man
Monsters

Misanthropes puff tuff,
buck up at your pigeonholes
Normal Christian home at a distance behind his picket rows
I was on a double yellow line
Beached with a Lilliputian
army to suffocate and divide
Suicide kings on the 495,
do the math, do or die,
never knew to chew the fat
Do his upturned, diamondbacks max flicker
The only shutter speed he ever had to shoot his thriller was
Winter 88, baby made a nest out of stories of Babylon and galactic unrest
Caddy stack of rumors on the shoeless express
Where you could read your epitaph before your foot even slips
And I keep adding to this Rube Goldberg
Mechanism after wacky mechanism loaded and holstered
They operate accordingly,
every bell and whistle had a trigger
But not an ultimate goal to compose toward Amigo
Study the mother of all Blitzkriegs
Shoulda kept the lambs and lions in split screens
Bitch please, panic will divide the herd at the vital nerve
Drivers who tidy and Firebirds, I emerge
Hayday like a symphony arranged in melee attacks
Wake em where the mayday is at
And when he stood up on the ledge where the pigeons guard the eggs
His brain hollered jump while his dark heart said
I walked through fire and did not get burned (x8)
These are the slings and arrows that sing carols on Arcadian rain
They're honeycombing kings and cowards the same
Not exactly Sunny D and school plays
Fluffernutter,
baby carrots more akin to pacing parent doomsday
Circle of abrasive parrots placed inside a room stay to
Duplicate the moves made
,
say form of lazy on some gladly pay you Tuesday
Two would follow suit into the crew suede
But you would rather lose it all than mutate
Weapon revvin up
, worms through your segments up
Bedlam as the leper section bed off through the lapel chump
And you were sweating bullets on some irony is golden
With no commitment issues in the moment
Itchy finger crispy when a morning you were open
Spin of liquors frozen ill of fortune down from any chamber chosen
And when it clicked instead of banged
The little breath that fled his fangs
Was drenched in the belief that you had hoped no one had noticed
But--this is not a competition of the damned
All Plebs broil equally,
no idiosyncrasies
That secretly would climb up out of the silver foil
Where the skippys pitter-patter past the sleeping killers coil
One man dogs playing poker yoke a harpy up
One hand on his heart like his bubble juice pocket car key tuck
One long mile of dog fence
Got him kicking a hornets nest until the sidewalk ends
Hey
Warm cider, barn full of spiders
Orange moon, starry night, particle exciters
In a pageant rivaled only by the origin of fire
Now add an organism from alternative environs
A dozen pair of cartoon eyes in a thicket
To see a neophyte get sliced into ribbons
I'm here to pick lice off each other and assimilate
Duck a suit, troubleshoot his moody user interface
True and suckerproof, grew to fully disengage
Float his only vanishing point away from the picture plane
Go to where the radio trails off
And people catch rabies on the way to their mailbox
Under a sideways rain cornering the briar
Still pull a broad sword from a hoarded synthesizer
Nap in a hole in a tree
Cat leaving voles at my feet
Talking Master P, memory foam everything
Jettison the rest and roulette us a new trajectory
Spinal Tap 11
,
tapping resin out the evergreen
Designated dark horse,  headless independently
Sidewalks end with ponds and frog eggs
Buried bones,
and his very own blurry sasquatch vids
Led like field ants to a hot lens
8 o'clock kittens vs cobwebs, fight!
Maps won't work here

Ice over bittersweet nightshade
Antlers rise from his migraine
Shred or die, life's strange
How do you identify?
New with the matutinal or peckish with the vespertine
Me, I'm pretty useless
Til the roof is painted Gemini, then set him free
Eat his own body weight in genocide
Came back a decorated dog of war
Who wants more though he currently stuck in the dog door
Additionally, dog isn't even his final form
Just a period, between greenhorn and Hyperion
Peer into the eye of a primordial experience
Portamento warriors in unforgiving wilderness
Borderline ethereal,
Noah's Ark room tone
Add a little up high down low too slow
Found acquaintances a pain to babysit
So he gave away his shit and gave 'em all the slip
Now pets hit the ceiling when the wind blows
Fish float belly up songbirds crash into windows
Swizzle apple cider vinegar and dish soap
Suicide flies take dips in the kill zone
Still shuffle thru a stack of old photos
Taken before the varicose verified Chronos
I dunno it feels weird
I'd rather feed an apple to a deer
It grows back
Dude, it grows back
It's ok it grows back
Ma!

There is a bowl cut template mapped with a billy can
Mega mom
scissoring a topiary lego man
Mini-ramp cowlick
Good ship snot nose
Lap rain water out of pigeon hill potholes
Rat brain,
shovel green peas offa butterknife
Racoon hat,
moon boots all summer-type
Felt pressure at the center of the dog show
Better off blending, sweater-off Waldo
You! Wanna see a genome mutate?
Cut a page boy 'til it bring home a Cube tape
Poof, screw-face wriggle out a chop shop
Home-brewed Kool-aid
,
Disavowing Osh Kosh
Simulating television
Little rowdy rock snob
Bobble-headed
shredder
playing top-heavy hop scotch
You realize you only got a week
'til you catch him with a set of shitty clippers in the sink
Like bzzzzt, motherfucking bzzzzt, bzzzzt
That's a quiet kid, buzzing asymmetric rebel lines in
Crudely, some say to praise the lord
I say you wanna feel saved baby shape the orb
And I will see you all in Helven
Read he fled a panic room pissed
And been searching for animal chin since
Bumpin' Johnny Rad
, eye on the sauce pan
Current mop: 4 months shy on the off-chance
Might just reset this whole shit
Cut it up, cut it up
Cut it up, cut it up
Cut it up, cut it up
Cut it up, cut it

Start with a text book bowl cut (Bowl cut!)
One you can mow down slow as you grow up
Learn a couple great new curse words (Pussy!)
Buzz a cool rat tail, take 2, your turn

"Haircuts! Get your five dollar haircut here! I can do mohawks, fauxhauks, afros, halfros, racing stripes, fringes, high top fades, mullets, reverse mullets, crew cuts and much much more!"
"No, I just needed a little off the top"
"Mirror? No, you can't look in a mirror, trust me, you look awesome!"
"I just want to take a look"
"Give me another buck and I'll trim "

I knew this kid Camu
who in the lion's mouth
Made up a fail safe way to get his life corralled
Let's say he short on the rent
His land lord is upset
He disappears with shears yelling "I'm going George Jeff"
Bathroom door sound like a part-mech barbershop quartet
Forced into war with itself
What emerge next in a shaft of light is bald up top
Long on the back and sides
Maybe the blade oil came with a ax to grind
But granddaddy half-smile, all mastermind
He asked, "How do I look?"
I said, "You look insane"
He said the haircut come with a theory, I'll explain
Please do
First: no hats allowed
Faux nat' male pattern when he out the house
And wouldn't crop it up until his monopoly prop pass go
'til then walk this town like an asshole
Bzzzt! Motherfucking bzzzt bzzzt!
Last week we were stoney
This week he program beats all Monday, sold two Wednesday
Pay rent, fabricate a whole new hedge maze
Back on his smooth shit Friday at noon bitch
Wow, just like that
A method I encourage you to share and apply and adapt
As one day his didn't grow back
So, if yours does, get that zig zig zag
Smack dab in the middle of the cuddles and kills
Guerilla jimmy city limits with a bucket of pills
Hollring 'no I don't immediately ameliorate 'em
I meet 'em, greet 'em, read 'em, and rate 'em, see if I hate 'em

Here come the hard rock bump through the speaker top
The tweeter meter blew code def hones in
I pack a lunchbox, walk to the stoning
Jump into the chemicals sold in my zoning
I'm irrational, paranoid, tragic
And the button on my chest says 'panic'
Punch it, hold up, don't touch me
I'm a savage from a rabid ass country

Who want to get it?
You all acquitted
You need to quit it
Getting evicted, you little idiot, pitching tickets
It's sorta tricky the way you wanna go get your digits
Body you up at the party, somebody get his mistress

You take a pitch black lung and a purple heart
Then you kick back once the inertia start
And when the shipwreck sunk through the perfect dark
The serpent's arch alerts every circled shark
See, bloody salt water sounds the h'ors d'oeuvres alarm
And when the first arm's found we observe the art
Like a belly-acher won't kick face to the curb
Rather kick when the face already raped by the worms

Tasmanian pain coast, ridin'
Very little to say to these politician behind it, but this:
You better loosen the noose or lose livin'
These little kids walking the ave. quick to produce a biscuit

Now you should medicate any area that the pain hits
And when you in the streets you should peep the sets of strangers
The actors that are in fact a cast of chaos
They be looking for any situation they can play on
Respectively injecting these thoughts, detain us
Negative speaking, they be creeping, they entertainers
When you out of data they run through a route that'll save ya
In retrospect, infect and pressing your papers
Used to draw
Hard to admit that I used to draw
Portraiture and the human form
Doodle of a two-headed unicorn-it was soothing
Movin' his arm in a fusion of man-made tools and a muse from beyond
Even if it went beautifully wrong
It was tangible truth for a youth who refused to belong
No name nuisance, stews in a bedroom
Oozing a brand-new cuneiform
Barely commune with the horde
Got a whole grayscale ungluing his world
Might zone out to the yap of the magpie
Unseen hand dragging his graphite
Cross contour, little bit of backlight
Black ink after a Bristol to baptize
You can't imagine the rush that ensue
When you get three dimensions stuffed into two
Then it's off to a school where it's all that you do
Being trained and observed by a capable few
Back in New York, five peeps and a dog
In a two-bedroom, doing menial jobs
Plus, rhymin' and stealin' and being a clod
Distractions free to maraud
I left some years a deer in the light
I left some will to spirit away
I let my fears materialize
I let my skills deteriorate
Haunted by the thought of what I should have been continuing
A mission that was rooted in a twenty-year affinity
In rickety condition with an ID crisis
Nap on the front lawn, look up in the sky, it's

Shapes falling out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
And there were colors pouring out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings

Used to paint
Hard to admit that I used to paint
Natural light on a human face
Stenciled fire on his roommate's bass
It was blooming addiction
Amiss in the pushing of pigment
Book like a tattooed pigskin, look
Pinhead kids of the minute
Drank Kool-Aid from a tube of acrylic
And it grew up into linseed oil over linen
Joy to the poison, voice of the resin
Capture a map of the gesture
Back up, add a little accurate fat to the figure
Redo that, move that inward
Zinc white lightning shoots from his fingers
Studio strewn with illusion and tinctures
Stay tuned for the spooky adventures
You can't imagine the stars that align
When a forearm starts foreshortening right
Or a torso hung on a warping spine
In proportion reads as warm and alive
Routine day with a dirt cheap brush
Then a week goes by and it goes untouched
Then two, then three, then a month
And the rest of your life, you beat yourself up
I left some seasons eager to fall
I left some work to bury alive
I let my means of being dissolve
I let my person curl up and die
Eating up his innards, an unfeasible anxiety
Has brutally committed to relinquishing his privacy
Aligning with the trials of the anti-Midas
Nap on the back lawn, look up in the sky, it'sYeah
A little bread, a little circus
It serve as a diversion for devils and death merchants
I was curled up underneath a swirling thread of reds and purples
Lumberjack flannel strappin' saddles over servals
Paddling in circles
with ten thousand maniacs
in Yankee caps
Who get to know the neighbors every time they tip the ladle back
Ragtag cats and canines
Who catch phat tags on the fabric of space-time
All work, no play
Dull boys rotate
Oldboy, Ghostface, Tolstoy, Coltrane
Throws up coffin nails, off the rails
Born bathed in a tornado of claws and tails
Got skulls on his sails
Cobras on the pleather
Salt-and-pepper soldiers barely holding it together
But supposedly awoke and down to mobilize whenever
You're pretty much a Gomer Pyle to pester, remember
I'm Pop-O-Matic Trouble,
I will commandeer the goulash
Under hockey-hair
Zoom off on a blue ox through the blog-o-sphere
With poppies for your mama bear
Carrots for the Vitamix
Kibble for the puppies, something bloody for the fire pit
Nevermind the appetizer writhing in a spider web
Stare into it long enough, you biters just might find yourselves
Tea with the dark side
Slimer on speed-dial
Sleep on a couch or a street or a leaf pile
Our kind cannot be redeemed
I'm a cancer on the glamour,
I can't with the "me me me"
No anesthesia surgeon with the signal jammers scrambling the feed
Distributing the panacea free
All day
There is no amount of "Our Father"s
That could remedy the black dog breathing down his collar
Mi casa like I'm Oscar, hot and poppin' out a flipped lid
Eyepatch, Prince wig
Disappearing grid blip
Stiff lip, sure to shit-talk a centurion
Tsk-tsk, I don't really wiggle with invertebrates
Purp in the thurible
,
Offsides toss thine merch in the urinal
It's nothing personal
Dirtbag don, don't provoke him to act up
I'm golden,
doing doughnuts in the Totoro cat-bus
Everything I touch turn to black sludge
Bugs in the bag lunch, punch through a Mack truck
Hunchback, get y'all acquainted with the contagion
Nobody safe, say hello to well beyond containment
I came for every cell between the belfry and the basement
You maybe wanna telephone your favorites
We take it where the warlocks lock horns
Soda pop, popcorn
Top-notch gore set to Bach over foghorns
Snotty nose, clogged pores, fork in his heart
Back away or catch a halo made of orbiting stars
Yeah
Transform in the dark
Got a dog nose sniffing out the source of the snark
Got a cat's ears twitching every snap of a twig
Triangulate your position, a simple rabbit to skin
I been an echo in the dark who demo applied science
At the parlay, barf rainbows and cry diamonds
Okay, ready Freddy, headlong into creeping death
Respawn where you least expect
I could pick a pin and tumbler right in front of the guard
Out the front with another Picasso under his arm
Hit the city limit still exhibiting his inner Caulfield, baby
I'm H-E-double hockey sticks on wheels
New dawn, show him how the voodoo doll feels
Plus launch fireballs from the palm heels
On an otherwise slow day
This is how I row into the rogue wave, yoHere we go, happy holidays
July 4th, 1981
Candles of a Roman ilk
Unloaded from a Chevy truck
Into the home her folks had built
Patio was charcoals and extended fam in folding chairs
Safely arced around the yard to focus on the smoking flares
Couple cousins, uncles, aunts
Mostly grown-ups, couple brats
Baby Ruby's only two,
she's too close to the jumping jacks
Mommy scoops her to the house, buckles up the booster seat
Rolls her to the storm door
,
let her long for all the lunacy
Telephone distracting Mom, Ruby wriggles out her strap
Fingers push the plexiglass, she's off into the sour patch
Past the pyrotechnics, undetected and invisible
Woke the sleeping beagle skipping toward the kidney swimming pool
Off into the yawning blue, the splash would mum the rocketships
Ruby's lungs were filling by the time her kin were cognizant
Many sprung and sprinted down,
all arrive belated but
The beast she had earlier stirred had been alert since waking up
Canine let his gainer fly, water-top commotion grow
Howling guests assume the cloven hooves had come to do-si-do
Frenzied and congested deck, part to let the others see
Soggy beagle gently dragging Ruby in his yellow teeth
Laid the tiny body in the sun before her father's feet
When she choked the liquid through her bluish lips he dropped his knee
Help the air to reconvene
, towel his shaking Ruby off
EMT confirm the save, everybody say "good dog!"
Severe cold, stare at the code
Keep a small circle like a deer in a scope
Let me clear my throat (Let me clear my throat)
Pocketful of rocket fuel and pyramid stones
Invoke a spirit from the parallel
Appearing as unwelcome news
That drag you to the shadow realm
And back for show and tell at school
Promising a future more bedraggled than bedazzled
When, "It isn't you, it's me," began the dagger to the scabbard
Free snake tats, plays on train tracks
Dorm like a door to Hell, the doorbell plays Taps
Born inside a ring of baffled demonologists
A casualty of otherness, what the fuck's an olive branch?
Rats as big as cattle sent to Babylon convulsing
The home sweet home that sees you as bag of hostile protein
While I do believe that you believe you're adding to the magic of the motif
Homie, all I hear is, "Dad, I want a pony"
Fuck the police, I'm floating out with the Camazotz
Property of nada, runs on Trompe le Monde and Otter Pops
Roger that, cobblestone beyond the common polygraph
His middle fingers wear little safari hats
Chainsaw shave in the house of a thousand tonics
They're magic if you need a cure for lack of sour vomit
Son, it's not a thing
Everywhere I go, I call to make sure there's a fog machine
Posse up and follow the anomalies

That's a unique wind
Spun a whip out in the snow
Really ain't got shit
Your condition is not a condition we know
Maximum effect
Maximum effect

The rats are back and built their own ship
They're backstroking faster than the old ship
A rat's a rat, it scatters, that's like its magic power
The bowing out it when your house is being smashed to powder
Ping in the rubble, located burning his bacon
Ravens deliver him trinketry in eternal damnation
I make disturbing the stasis a game to beat when the mania boils
Even the days when the pavement's keeping his platelets employed
Stole an ox on occasion
I go through wands too quickly to name 'em
Okay I'll name one, it's the rod of fuck the nonsense
A basic wave and nod'll turn bravado into fondant
We slalom from beyond the wildly oscillating compass
Whether you connect the dots or not is truly not my problem
Familiar with the color of permanent cloud cover
Though I've heard there might be others, I'll buy it when it buffers
Until then a dry and lifeless pile of, "Whys?" and, "Ay carambas"
In a bubble watching dumpster fires multiply in numbers
I know that fear and love and death and pride and romance hold you by your Chukkas
Though it's unclear what some closure might encompass
A bid to visit symmetry from civil war and swim ashore
Sob story same as yours, but a little more, ha
I'm in the alley pacing, I'm skirting curtain call
I make my hospital corners in a circle of salt
Killings reflect the destiny of the village
So when 20 count regrets float down futility spillage
See I'll pass the broken arrow this time for certain
Yeah but from here on out it's hoofed mare or bare footed urchin
Dig in your person
Now exhibit true audacity and passively hack reason to ribbons
And you're excused from the round-table admissions committee
Activist legends turned hostage in fallen cities
Dirty earthlings circling vision immaculate
Spin me dizzy in a crosswalk
My too far gone mastodon senses inspect relentless
For fitted boogie systems with crook addictions
Well sure my crown is formed of thorns
Yeah but my thorns are formed of sound
And I have found sound's what keeps me warm
When mornings born with frozen ground
Throw the rope down, pull me from where the buzzards cleared
The meat from the bones of you and your little bad-ass mad max musketeers
When the silhouettes of emaciated frames dance on a high-wire
Mistook for aspiring third world poster children
But is inserted ghost with dealin'
Dare to administer links like chieftain whats your forte
Knuckle dragger in disguise seeking the match made in your eyes
Friend it don't take the wisest men in triplicate pacing to find
I don't condone the blasphemy hatchery's procreation
From the floods, to the fires, to the droughts, to the cyclones
Tidal waves, the twisters, tornadoes, and hail stones
Whirlwinds, tropical storms, blizzards and monsoons
All of which I witnessed prior to waking up inside my room
Look at the crook as I panic episode tantrums
Fuck hugging my cool
The edginess readies the Mach 9 quick draw hence the duel
The company of similars couldn't excite the motor
But hermit crab Aes home a-loner
One barrel of idioms and charcoal stick, courage under desire
Canopy draped beautiful messiah reluctant
Stuck in the pluck in the harp buzzing the fuzzing television mixer
Book of saturated matches and a half-made bed (sleep on my other half made bed)
Pick of the litter, litter of the pick
Pack leader will huff cannibal fumes
, mechanical zoom
There's ample room
Stowaways inside the cargo bed
Said leech
prior to firing up his barnacle magnet
Instincts leashing himself to where the wind splitting ice storms
And termite swarms are commonplace
I'm a trace this silver lining winding round the profit chase
I know there is good in you if one peels back the opulence
But I also know its ratio to bad don't feed my confidence
The nutrients moody tints of blue circle
The clues units of success being personal
Then sucked basic diversion
Rusty anchor budging for nothing
Wedged between aesop rock and a scarred face of frustrated fuck yous Bound by concern
I can't believe I'm still concerned
I can't believe sly children turn in their sleep over one-liners
While I yield to hear your burns
Color me out of my skull draggin' a wagon of creature features
And all I ever wanted was to aggravate the sleepers
Look self-crafted heroics murder worthless
Crash test ideologies, catalog alien doctrines type disturbance
Got em out, killing machines turn belly up
Buckled, the troubles I've seen
Coax twenty four sevens of wide eyes from day dreamers
Clean or dirty serpents in turn wish preference for the latter
Justified the germs birth cauterize the gashes after
On my left, one finger for each borough I can touch
On my right, one finger for each time that I wake up midsummer night
Who's cloaked in a pristine mantle of hellfire
But A-capital glaciers out the east slide lateral
Born for one task indeed
To spoil the citizen kane emote self this ugly duckling seed
Look I too am tired
of draggin' the baggage over the seesaw seats
When the reapers turns mortals to caspers
See the plain and stone conjurable can't mimic the null
Of a billion troops holding matchsticks to empty cannons
Stand in for many moons when the sun hit the mountainside splendidly
Bask in the last warmth that be known to man's tangents
In the wink of an innocent starchild's eyelid drop he vanished
Managed to carve initials in the granite wall that damned it all up
I hung with cats that do the don'ts
Cats that forage through the moats
Hoping they'll open with sovereignty and a canteen deemed with prodigies
I log the wake, the watch, the walk, the work
The well it's almost six o'clock
I've never seen so many tugboats miss the dock (watch)Step on the lawn I keep the foot, peep
In the pot go six degrees of cooked geese
Boiling, blitz the beach of mushed peas
Over ten meat hooks with a blister each
I'm all pincer, fevery hoodie-on hoodie-off
Sweat through his
E.T.
sheets to the worry dolls
Never met a quiet storm
That didn't grow into a choir of colliding horns
That go "click click clack" in territorial syntax
Sitting on the porch with his lids pinned back
Pinball whiz in a thimble of Sims
I'm a symbol of whimsy abridged
Kiss Me, I'm Dead
Nursing a mystery, DayQuil
Led Zep staring daggers down page mill
How pray tell do he sit pretty?
When the old one-two unglue in a tizzy
Please hold for the don't-play dull boy
Click: I am not a page or a pull toy
Came in the door and the floor is lava
Killjoy if your core more Norman Rockwell
Born homesick for an invisible address, batshit
Bumble and bat around catnip
One black-heart Katamari massive
Packed in a fat category-5 rat nest
Nose on his sleeve
, holes in his inner peace
Robot phone like a tentacle of flippancy
I hate you (I hate you more)
No, I hate you infinity
And Pangaea break into smithereens
Interlude presto change-o
If it move too quick (oh whey oh)
Right brain go write train Ramo
Mustache any old Monet, (no)
Yes
Merrily merrily merrily merrily
In a cobweb tomb on a hotbed of heresy
Frogmen schooled by the god Ed Emberley
Pull dog sleds and exhume Dead Kennedys
Bet: moth into kerosene awful
A caution to straw men lost on Vaudeville
Amorally mixing business
With 144 Dixie Whistlers
Lawnchair strongman twisted whiskers
NASCAR Bic in his missing fingers
Outcast from a system of kiss-the-ringers
Are you privy to the misadventures?
"Chill with that ill behavior!"
"Chill with that ill, ill behavior!"

Pull the pin out,
sheep creep in wolf garb
Fronted by the Hail Mary parry lunge mix
Kill the populace for stability, jeopardy's a stickler
It's bob and weave amalgam played the falcon to your fixture
I branch out, arms flailing backwards
Whaling upon a tidy sound circuit,
slightly foul Gershwin
With a bed of nails and drum lust, plus disgusting service
Working in shifts opposite the asbestos brain furnace
I be the now observatory: eye, ear, antenna feeler
Spitting like a dragon with a similar demeanor
Stood innocent bystand, witness the die-hard fans turn Rip Van
In the poppy fields of N.Y.'s orchestrated brick gauntlet
Now I'm thinking, "Who am I?" Jabberwocky Superfly, bent left
Pushing war without the ten step cushion, and what? (What?)
I plan to hold this B-positive sacred in these golden veins
Until the day I die from grimace overload
It's shock (It's shock)
Treatment offered by the weekend
Dystopia getaway, let's display the sequence, it goes:
One for the heartless thievery turning my guardian angel harpless
And the rest to sweep the mess under the carpet (Under the carpet)
I drag a yellow taxi meter
Behind every measure and charge cats for labeling me shepherd
"That'll be 6.50 plus tip, darling
I take cash, credit, check, money-order, gold and cigarette cartons"
Got caught up in the universe trying to zoom in on stardom
Forgot the passion plus the hatred, both were based in Carbon
Next time you wanna be a hero, try saving something other than hip-hop
And maybe hip-hop'll save you from the pit-stop
Kill 'em all, yield
(Naw, man, it wasn't me it was Holden Caulfield, brother
I just read and pulled the trigger)
Oh God, well leave me to tiptoe past the pearly gates
Capture the halo, jet back to base, step
Fast to chase the bad taste of jet lag and waste slackers
There ain't nothing broken, where you at?
The pistons pump perfect, where you at?
The bass tone is Merlin, where you at?
The services of urgent working surgeons
Purging formulas looking for an improper cause is whack
 (x2)
What are you saving, honestly? (Honestly, honestly)
What are you saving, honestly? (Honestly, no honestly)
What are you saving, honestly? (Damn)
Promise me you gon' shut the fuck up and recognize
What you holdin ain't really broken

I don't flick needles like my sick friend
I don't march like Beetle Bailey through a quick trend
I don't frequent church's steeples on my weekend
And I don't comment if you formulate a weak Zen
All I ever really wanted was a getaway
I'mma take a chance by letting a rook slide forward out of my hands
I cannot agree to follow a leader along a borderline
Of war without a reason for the "ready, aim, score."
Bring out your dead, we can put 'em in a pile
And burn 'em with the novels for the kiddies to admire
Kill the ones that speak from a different life brew?
I'd rather kill the noisemaker that separated the two

Okay, welcome to the Kamikaze bottle rocket cockpit
Live by the icy cold hand of bad intention youth blender
Oh, yeah, I'll let God warm the bench for now
But I'll ascend to spin y'all dizzy
(And for the record I'm bringing my TV with me)
It goes: let the commoners speak publicly
Then disperse eye jammies for cats that swear by third pupil
But can't see past the loophole
Motherfucker, my word is born like Siamese triplets
With doctor, lawyer, rocket scientist promise
(Let 'em grow leisurely)
Hey Mom, I'mma fix whatever I broke along this path
Once my spiel's perfected, I'mma save you a seat in the front row
Of Aesop Rock's twelve steps to shut the fuck up seminar
And when all these bickering crowds turn silent you gon' be proud
I tack hacks to the (backboard)
Honesty's a (patchcord)
Fury's far from (obsolete)
Serenity's a (crack whore)
Raw caricature of mayhem standard, branded by the labor
With a thousand reasons to end this for every one of you saviors
Saw the brightest burst ironically wandering the vacant stage
Gave it a pound for burning where bunk ratio's engaged
Keep me posted as to when you grasp something mature to
Sit and sulk about mister, and I'll consider picking up your record
"And you can come and meet my mother
Any day you like; System 605, Unit 91"

I forever wallow in glitches, grimly distributed by side effects
Consumed, cocooned in antisocial trenches, drenched
Cradled between dense pillars of polar value
Lies a grey soul blueless, it's got I fiending for the sky
(Synthesized lies rise synthetic)
Sitting inside solidified plastics whose lateral burns germ-compatible
My firm's radically piloted, dodging a fire swiftly
Yellow-brick stalker walking shifty
I'm but a prototype Metroid programmed to holocaust style
While you're sulking in the stages of denial
Your petty soldiers stand fragile like Giacometti sculptures
Embedded in eremetic cultures we's rocksteady vultures
Plus I's the geyser throwing a soul
My wingspan stands flags in the snow of the poles, berserk!
Swerve my alignment towards solitary confinement and jaded
Tripping, color my passion mitigated, I'm slipping

You always seem like a small grey cat to me
Sleeping underneath the silvery moon
Paws curled beneath your head
'Til the sun came 'round just around noon
And you would greet me, purring in your doorway
Drawing at your tail around my hips
And I would go into your mouth wide open
Waiting for my language to come from your lips

And I'll move you, and you like it
Just enough to let me
And I hate you, 'cause you're lonely
And you know how to forget me

For the love of my personal practice I reside
Where obstructive fluxes and societal withdrawal collides
Slide fueled by the fury, spun a ring around my honor
But the opulence took shelter in my hollow
Melancholy masquerade, cast amongst the braiding of belligerence and
Blazing terror that blew the lock down off my placement
I stay special agent 'til the sky falls
Reverse the curse 'til my fellow Lost Children disperse
I don't shrug. I study the ramifications of my shovel
Loving the consequence of uprooting the jungle
I'm hugging the cycle of Gemini's duplicate tenants for muting the puzzle
I don't budge the motives
Encased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas
I don't shrug. I study the ramifications of my shovel
Loving the consequence of uprooting the jungle
I'm hugging the cycle of Gemini's duplicate tenants for muting the puzzle
I don't budge the motives
Encased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas

My kitchen sink leaks like you're itching to speak your secret
'bout the world spins yet nobody's pledged allegiance and why
His beaming smile knew a private agony that burns
And when the children met divinity I sat to watch the merge
It goes pandemonium live
Ya'll mutha fuckers stand up. Volunteer tantrums while your plan sunk, vivid
Play your sympathy card, son of misery classed with
The basket cases is in a classless matrix with elastic patience
I zig in a zagging only zone
Draggin a bag of lonely poem remnants
Short of breath like you're short of fresh
You're a portable mess
Carpetbagger spearheading tear peddeling pretentious art critics,
orphans
Trying to dismiss those pioneering their fortunes
You're a spectacle
Pushin for pedagogue lacin up paper weights walkin on stilts talking
You touched the hand of God and I'm like
What are all these evils that plagued the hearts of man
By sweet talking border patrol until they fold and let them in
You got your life in a basket before you could say instant classic
Like the king of the mountain requires a boost
I'll bury the hook in my belly just to volunteer at live bait clinics
For the thrill of 9 great mimics with 18 bloody lips, spittin
Beanstalk, chalking outlines before figures fly
Walking uphill trying to get down
Prominent ghost town litigate battle pitch darkness
When the light switch hits the artistry circuit board breaker
Servicing the greater half of nature
See money go wild shook when the exploitation incubated lovely
Warmingly piggy leader colony to comfort
Numb enough to deny the sin pins and evil needles even punctured
Till he woke to find his tourniquet still functions
My first name is a random set of numbers and letters
And other alphanumerics that changes hourly forever
My last name, a thousand vowels fading down a sinkhole to a susurrus
It couldn't just be "John Doe" or "Bingo"
My address, a made-up language written out in living glyphs
Lifted from demonic literature and religious text
Telephone, uncovered by purveyors of the ouija
When checked against the CBGB women's room graffiti
My social, a sudoku;
my age is obscure
My in-case-of-emergency is in the daisies, chasing birds
Employed by trillionaires with perfect teeth and pores
And people who open doors for the people who open doors
My medical history is a course at SUNY Buffalo
Charlatan psychiatry and troubleshooting undertow
Nervous in the service, still; I'm burger meat and purple pills
-"Here." -"Thank you. We'll call your name." -"Sure, you will."

Skipped lunch
I'm shrunk

You pack up all your manias, you're sitting in the waiting room
You're dreaming of arcadia, you're feeling like a baby tooth
Awaiting panacea, channeling your inner Beowulf
In purgatory, just before you pay up to filet yourself and others
In the name of help, coal on a conveyor belt
Into ego death alone, no telephone from Gabriel
I'm half a human, combin' over
Home and Garden
, stoned
Gold chains over turtleneck, cigars over cologne
A thousand shitty paintings wrapped around a wounded animal
Woo him with the Schubert,
he's a future human cannonball
Little fuckers fighting, mother hiding in her Hulu
I'm climbing up the stucco, let's get to the seppuku-uh-oh
That pretty penny turned the prickly into Benji
If you save up all your winnings, then you get to count your blessings
I finally crunched the budget up and punched the button
She called my name out and pushed me into an oven

The fuck?
I'm shrunk
Thou mayest indeed
Tune onto the forbidden channel
And see it like it is baby
Who shall be our champion?
What manner of channel beholdest thou
Shall it fall on me?
Deceit, deceit, deceit
"Getting dusty in the cellar"

Yo
I always think about my sick friend
Stringing a ring around my wit's end
Thirteen loops later his feet hung inches out the pig pen
Motley day goblins brought up pillage to pass the stillness
With bad javelin tip dipped inside barreled black magic brilliance
Who rose at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier?
To capture the fascist fragment choreographed in traffic dancing for nickels
Hooked like sickle cells to the principles of comradery
One hope distortion odyssey sputters itself to my how not example sample
Divvy the bread crust while considering the littering
I don't pity the head rush or the whimpering,
spill
Anchor to rock bottom, rocks bottom packs a ravenous catalyst
Sprung alacritive, leashed by the carnal tirade
I choked when the cage bird sings it stings
Springs me up delirium to stitch the clipped wings
I sink instinctively brinked through while clinging the shrieking souls
Mourning the death of annal logs/analogs and quality control
Quality control, stand still string up the banner
From the beehive to the anthill; rag dummy
Incorporate the unison of Vikings Ship Rowers PLUS the perfection
Of the twice the Birds with half the Stone Throwers, speak your assessment
My communicative hindrance pleads the needs
Of a billion hungry victims gripped by the hell that's split to splinters
Shimmying up the mast of natives and it's league marvels
One component short of shock and mass burial, breeze
Broken penny bank fragments float up at stagnant seas
Dirty work plus applicants with chatter box disease
Iron bandit, giving the stars, the head balloons and rubies
Asked for many moons and I can't stand it any more
I like skating to the store at night in autumn weather with a couple layers on
And maybe Wu playing over soft wheels on a mellow inclined plane
It's those moments I could swear to anything that I'm the ultimate
Although it goes against the frequency on which I otherwise vibrate
Still an alternate dimension isn't shit to miss
Do the 'rithmatic
I been ignoring every ache and pain to push into the lion's own gum line
Navigate a bit of fire and brim, nevermind whatever transpire within
I'm out the other side a golden beam of lost sunlight
You take a brittle bone out for a little spin, I'm mostly into outer space
Or underneath a haunted freeway overpass, around a storm-worn flat square
Kicking wooden toys around and vandalizing random city property
A proper way to pencil-in a Saturday without cab fare
Bulldozer dozing over every brick or black top
Spin the backdrop
Metropolis or in the pretty backwoods
Bring wax, thanks bye
Black ops, all flat spots
Rat-a-tatting in forgotten back lots
Steady feel a pull to power-slide around brake lights
See him off into the fog
Figure 8-ing in the moon
Never let him know the odds
It isn't part of how I move
See him off into the foul
Celebrating in the road
Never let him know the count
It isn't part of how I go
Seven years old and he's dying of old age!
And I don't give a fuck about any of you limp
bizkit
funny boys!

I was on some all in together
Whether whore, whether beggar
Whether rat or weathered leper
Come and cut this edge a second
We could build a better network
Without all the yes sir, yes sir

Post cannons up
Pull the pulse up outcha mans and what
Dick and Jane escape into the arcane where the phantoms fuck
Itchy skin he sits inside shifty village snitching
Grin and gargle when they argue happy
Are you happy? Sit and spin (sink or swim)
He kick his fins and wave his bony arms around
For guards who beg your pardon
While the arson burns your harvest down
What a darling town
What a snarling partridge farm
The bars are like a car with clowns
The parks are like a garbage barge
But still it was our parthenon
We part to train tomorrows argonauts and archers
With lungs that match their markers
Like army parkas marching
Through the marsh with buzzing sparklers
To carve apart the harpies
And disarm the budding marksmen
Are you charged up?
This be the trench foot kicking
Through the
ten
cook kitchen
Spoiled beef and chicken
We gobbled up the chemical in heaps, in new relief
Was thirty minutes past
The chalky tablets melting in our teeth
A dagger in the back became a fad to swagger jack
With no medicinal maggots to lap the gashes aftermath
These are the crazers of the Benadryl nation
That'll steal the very bacon
Off your plate, thats so raven
Been jittery killer-the artillery parties
Lit up like symphony of pretty Ataris
Fitting the knitting needle splintered through the kewpie
Duke(?)
I speak in a dead language New York is hollerin' through me
Note the lazy foe be seven clicks outside the poppy fields
Telescopes and coffee spills
Folding chairs and orange peels
Peanut shells and all is fair
In loving brawlers crawling through the august air
That's the muggy handicap we all must share
And morning smells like blood worms
In the beaks of the very falcon
But how can arrested splendors
Of wretched sleep walk the palate
Palpating hearts like woe to you rascal eddy hazels
Which one of you bitches would flip the table?
On the train
Watchin' the rainbows (thank you window seat)
I mean, it's all the same to some
But that cityscape makes me numb
Walkin' the wire between firewater and water - I'll take the tap
Still managed to end up thirsty the day the nursery collapsed
In my hand I hold the plumage of a buzzard
Suffered for circlin' nutrition (seems barbaric)
I may have just saved your children
There's an inborn tendency tellin' me to grip that sickle
For The pirate tyrant breeds feed on your precious little pixels
I interviewed the sun, he said the future's lookin' bright
I interviewed the rain, he claimed the sun's truly an asshole
I was supposed to interview the snow today but of course he flaked
So I let my frigid demeanor teeter and take his vacant place
We 3 sprout from the same litter
Yet amazingly crafted by separate scissors
I sloth from off the beaten path splashed in the cretin blizzard
Half my time is herded toward little lost causes
Half my time is spent pluggin' these leaky faucets
An' I'm here to pose inquiries
I'm here to draw a fork in the road and call it the diary of common sheep aspiring
Little Billy starlet up the block got the right premise
But can't thread the needle without consultin apprentice present
I don't really know you (I don't)
And I dont' really care (I don't)
Can't judge a man's dignity by the wattage in his stare
Maybe that deems me that vagabond you love to kill
But I really ain't got time for the motherfuckin guilt

I'm gone and I best believe I'm leavin'
Pack up my belongings then it's off into the evening
Now I haven't exactly been embraced by the populace
Set sail upon the
seven deadly seas
of the anonymous
I'm gone and I best believe I'm leavin'
Pack up my belongings then it's off into the evening
An' I'm diggin' a tunnel to where the sun'l never shine
I've got my book I got my dream I've got myself an' I'll be fine
(My time) is the day before the day the earth stood still
(My time) is the day before the soldiers fired at will
(My time) is the day before the hunter made his kill
My time's the final mile before the valley meets the hill

And I'm an archer
Parked where the farmers barter appetites
Sweet-talkin' harassment down to a mere flashing of badges
Prototypic landscape chased every step of my well-oiled collective
Workforce with frozen intention festive - wait
What about the captivated?
Well, I am the product of skeleton dancers poised crooked
Scattered amidst blue fields of fiery bliss mixed with
Disease applicant activist rattlers fascinate grave child
Oh you're expecting slave smiles after sticking the pin in limb
God, if I could offer maintenance to fantasies I would
I'd place the button in the city square for everyone to push
You see my mission responsibilities range across the board
Until I'd rather be a pen than a sword
I swim a cold lake, make no mistake, I was not ready
All edgy and outta shape, made the company look messy
(Sorry, well sorry) Honestly take it or leave it
Just let me know so I ain't beggin' forgiveness throughout the evening
Basic locomotive with a whistle and caboose
Tryin to pull my cargo 'cross the map without a boost
Fragile in more ways than ten yet sturdy bird construction
Help the smokestacks puff until the morn, dream torn
Bamboo shoots, Buddhas and removed shoes
Pugilism brewing over whose tuk-tuk's whose
Moving through the super-moon with goonies off a distant block
And fugitives from Dusit Zoo in pleasant moods until they're not
Present mood a startling departure from the temple rules
Part of it's the temperature, part of it's the tentacles
AQI alarming, surgical masks marching
The durian got him gagging, the traffic is anarchy, um
Siam spy cam, try him in fire
I'm marigolds and Muay Thai into the eye of the tiger
I almost died on a scooter, I almost died on a boat
I figure fuck it, baby, come as you are and die as you go
North bound, Lopburi, where it's humans: zero, monkeys: one
Humans fear the monkeys won, get your mirrored sunnies, run
Later watched a billion bats exploding out a mountain cave
Climbed a couple hundred feet to stare into the mouth and change
Descended a little different, every atom individually cleansed and repositioned
That's one unconventional exorcism for the kiddo
Hearts on his pillow, bars on the window
Bar band send it from John Denver to G-n-R
Midnight playing sardines to the sleeper car
13 hours, couldn't sleep at all
Even eating weed it's hard to catch a Z
Over all the sneeze and cough, jeez
I might never make it out
If I ever make it out send me back in
Got lost got found
Got a feeling I should lose it all again
OK, heaven is a humid room, it emulate a human womb
Everyday we celebrate a water birth in noodle soup
And cruise around as ronin trying to expedite a slow death
Playing chicken with a family of 5 on the same moped
Golden lotus that show off a pretty pantone
And grow in river water that'll melt your fucking hand off, damn
It's funny 'cause I fake a smile too
People thinking you're ok until you take 'em to the root
Imma take 'em to the root
Through insatiable depravity and layers of abuse
Down to radiate the truth
Ok, my homie said "I just got blessed by a monk"
I said "I got no frame of reference, God is dead where I'm from"
Still I been doing what I can to get these devils expunged
Lately it's laying sugarcane across an elephant's tongue
I'm wading out into the mud to scrub her belly and trunk
Brushing that yellow off her tusks, shit is better than drugs
It feels strange, hurdling emaciated strays
Even stranger days later when I'm no longer phased
Locals see a space garbage that fell from the interstellar
Trying to blend in with the smell of peppers, sweat and citronella - ella
Sore thumb in the hum of the helter-skelter
Rebels huffing through the temple run like Zelda's in the cellar
Every L.D. call an awful omen
Excuse me while I walk into the ocean, likeHola...!
Let's go ya'll
One for the money
What up?
What's good in the galley?
This one for the ghosts
Sniffin glue in the alley
I bounce with a set of sims
Equipped with a foul jowl moment
Waitin for that great celebrity towel throw-in
(Now) Aes train invasive species how to bleed stones
Cold Ol' Yeller
Rogue shelter melter
Drag a leech pelt caper to rubble he call home
Then leap out of Gattaca to cuddle in brawl mode
All city, crawl wrong, the brawny ogres of Weatherville
Little Billy Spill-a-gut
He hopped up on vendetta pills
One man walkin' through a world of mother fuckers
Like one Ben Hawkins in a world of Brother Justins
Bust the
Hellcat on a Hot
Tin
, or rock a sars mask
And limp their red carpet
To cough in a pop star's hands
When the troublesome bubblegum music nation eats itself
The meek inherently evacuate his arm span
Tarzan of Long Island savaged to feed the fam (Fam)
Who stuff candles alongside scavengers of the damned (Damned)
Stubble waste and insects
Orphaned to crooked portions
When looked at
In comparison to the fortunes and boredom
Who pussy for the dollar?
Fuck it
Whore 'em
And I label that
Now my sheep is a shepherd's table scrap
Play with that
Sailors knot
Wine for his limbs
Plus a cane and hat
Shake it for the same critics
Who later will fillet the fact
Yeah, my up-jump's the boogie
You'll jump start the noogie-wagon
Lookie
Up jumps the Jukie (Jukie)
Cold (cold)
Get retarded
And bother you
Till you buy my shit
Like Smiley to Mookie
Aesop-riggidy-Rock
He up and walked off
Showed 'em how the zeitgeists walk dogs
Showed 'em how to
Dodge boss hogs when the markers are gripped
Screamin, "Damn!  I'm gettin too old for this shit!"
Sip One
We kill 'em with cuts and no alibi
Fly shit
Raised in the heart of NY shit
This is not your over-the-counter rap
More like over the counter
Into the
Klonopin
and back
Overhaul that!
Keep shit crispy!
Keep using your fifteen minutes to diss me
I love it
Thanks
One sec' left
Have a nice life
Good night
God bless
Electric charge comin' from the mainframe
I'm from where the phat beats stretch for mad blocks
Electric charge comin' from the mainframe
I'm from where the phat beats stretch for mad blocks

My every little step set in a star
Retina scarred; tread in a sled of bedbugs got my dead head in a jar
Crazer camp stamp blank on the mug of settlers registered
Not protest nor approval regarding every morn futile
My experience with a spirit alignment interference
Assigns division from clearance to ample scrambling
Let's note the magnificence in the difference
Okay, see two canaries on the wire aspire
To separate lullabies both of which had me drifting
Every clan ghostly orphan scared stiff in the bliss
And list picking from the arrangement under burden
Bust, wallow in will to split the privilege cluster
Lackluster as if a journey choice grew on the nearest chuckle path-dispatch trouble
I've never seen the water so high in my poison life
Social conduct, twenty pace, about face, self destruct
I know the key locations, sharp enough to catch those subtle signs cause
Well, this here alley cat's been around the block a couple of times
Lifting every tin can
,
sifting every mess
;
One man's trash, you know the rest, live it
Pitching a battered platform out of mass hysterics perished in the blizzard
When it's finished I plan to sit and observe the twister pivot
Sleep and sleep well; sleep with a sacred array of fevers
Wake as a pertinent version of a pipe dreamer
Y'all can find me if you lookin for a friend
I'll be the only iron-clad oracle in a city of tin
It's like that

I was born where crooked demeanor seemed to spawn merit
I was born where all the king's men couldn't mend a broken spirit
I was born where it don't matter if you stand, sit, or fall
To live and die as a brick brick brick in the wall
And I'm a brick brick brick brick brick in the wall
And I'm a brick brick brick brick brick in the wall
And I'm a brick in the wall, drop in the bucket, yes y'all

Electric charge comin' from the mainframe
I'm from where the phat beats stretch for mad blocks
Electric charge comin' from the mainframe
I'm from where the phat beats stretch for mad blocks
Electric charge comin' from the mainframe
I'm from where the phat beats stretch for mad blocks
Electric charge comin' from the mainframe
I'm from where the phat beats stretch for mad blocks

Spare a match for the most distorted orchid in the patch
Assorted orphans coursed in a morbid orbit forward the traps
I make a tentative promise to flash frequent
The most sacred abrasive based in allegiance to the makeshift mason's secrets
Water basin leaking, plug it up
The simple triple ring performance shoveled subtle imperfection
I rung a life's worth of saturated costume gear over hell's balconies
To nullify the drought and still the martyr farmers shout at me
And so the epic went and every cirrus hung
The bow breakers turned a cradle fatal, every spirit clung
Croon for the slick Icarus brain children busy splitting the givingtree
Building fresh canoes for freaks to cross the spill in
I'm frantic
My plan is dwindling with every pulse bump
Gods and monsters yield the lump sum of the dolt clump
Be wary when the stratosphere tints
I scout like Atticus Finch
, inching up slow in the games of reconnaissance
Now cause to amend the Zen memorandum has surfaced in every Holocaust citadel fix it plan
Twelve easy steps to better picket line demeanor
Gumshoe
Stick stone conglomerate activate massive
But the sky is falling, fuck you
I've hired sweatshop labor to hold candles to the solar panels
Stitched in the back of my neck for nickels and sour milk by the week
Cheek to the heartache
At the center of my anthem lies a blend of temper tantrums substantial for me to lamp inHuh? Whos there? Dog at the front door barking at the air wind all wshsehw in the trees then chk chk chk chk feet on leaves uhhhhhhh.....??? Its probably a cat might be a guy with an axe might be a trap shit its probably a trap might be a possum in the trash its probably a trap Hey keep it moving god i sound stupid good chance im not even talking to a human then again its probably a trap somebody had to set it depending on the type maybe several ya that's its probably several several come together to make what would have taken one forever im thinking its a pretty dam sophisticated trap utilizing some technology i didn't know we had hmmm...  Maybe im am entirely trippin it might have been the neighbors kid but i have my suspicions i wish it were as simple as a critter but it isn't i feel that it's important we consider all dimensions like oooohh i dont know maybe its a trap i step on to the lawn y'all jump out with a bag i wakeup in some alley on a wholely other plane can't remember who i am or how to get back to the base i realize you people think that i am off the deep end ill say that it's a lovely night regardless of the BS it is.. A perfect snow is sprinkling the path it's almost like the atmosphere is beggin for a trap. The mutt go's quiet one last sniff lopes inside. Fine. it might have been a baby squirrel who tumbled from the nest it's prolly just you motherfuckers missed
I skunk the blood up as to numb the public interface
Before the anime corrodes I'm tryin' to fork the figure eights
Hogwash etiquette, truncate long haul leverage picket
Outbuild auto-bricklayers with 10 guerrilla digits
A to Don Darko, bark O beautiful piranha gossip
Cobwebs on the Kafka, choked up on Watcher logic
With a left-center field indicator gesture gently
Smash when the 101-octane hemlock tea pumps chest to extremities
And phenom limp it to the wicked recon
Prowler fist up with a Bowser twist vs. America's kooky coward clips
(Pump breaks, cupcake) I melt through the father formula
Goofus murked Gallant, the missing link was apparent
Drugstore cowboy, hold floors and grudges
Fuck the Judy piece while Elroy burgle space cakes from the cupboard
I could kill a cockroach with only Wallabees and rug burn
Pin 'em down and funnel up boric acid chuggers if stubborn
Mash jackals, hacks flash Bedazzlers
Capture flags and crash test happy campers
For the typecast ponies grazing through the weekend
Ring alarms with bassy kicks that flip whips on the Major Deegon
Left out of dodge nauseous (I don't feel good)
Yo El, leave the keys to the Delorian with Lauren at the office
I peak the 88 streak off with a fiery disposition
And basic serotonin deficient symptoms
Die already
None defy the one-man walled city
Stone made flesh, veins etched in his hands
88 stance draped in invasive plants
And rain dance unsafely, brace for the supercell
Mutiny or footage for your blooper reel, who can tell
Pours hot tar from the top of the barn
Necktie on his head, condor on his arm
Dog Star in a jar, bordering unsustainable
Mea culpa, mea culpa, maybe I should pray occult
Systematic Catholic or sigil of the Baphomet unraveling
Either way his ID show a snake and skull
Always been a private dude who couldn't keep a tally
Of which lies he told who
Dye his hair, shave, change names and his lazy drawl
Soon enough I will estrange you all
I get ghost

Ghossssst
Now the beat goes!

On Dasher
Half-dead carolers deck a hall, wreck a whole advent calendar
Brother on speakerphone lurking at the Burgerville
Bathrobe hammer toes murdering the curb appeal
Would I be returning or forsaken with the craven and
Carnivorous vegetation that take him for his Steak-umms
I dunno I gotta think about it
Truthfully I don't know which makes me a bigger coward
Either stomach all the hubris, cash in his two cents
Loose lips locked up over a chewed Eucharist
Or, maybe re-appropriate the energy
Holed up, passing the poultry to Hecate
Bullheaded burn out fled his own pedigree
And never better, never would've met your Heaven anyway
Anyway, merry merry go make soup out of bones
Just know when the room go cold
I'm a ghost

Ghossssst
G-H-O-S-T
Ghost ghost ghost
He's ghost
The dirty dishes are becoming self-aware
Even the roaches like "I wouldn't raise my children here"
Simple syrup in his veins, dirty nails, lizard brain
Eyes wide, spine like a saltlick in pissing rain (pssss)
ASR Schroeder split the rent with ghosts and bacterial cultures
Might track poltergeists prints through his Folgers, gross
Home is where the unholy sojourn
Dead sea bath tub
Never mind his welfare
Party at the penthouse carpeted in pet hair
Fridge full of black deli meat and dead air
Sill prefer it to the overbearing lens flare
And death stare Plinko and an at risk eco
System, egos over peace, love, and wisdom
Police shooting everything
Media's a fuck show
Religion is a scapegoat for cut-throats
Fuck no

I ain't going out there, man
I don't trust no one out there, man
You don't even know what's out there, man
Man

Sycophants is on the prowl so I don't need to do laundry
I'll dry myself with paper towels
Can't have a decent conversation with the butcher, baker, or candlestick maker
At least they smoking vapor now
I still am not going to vacate and ain't breaking out
It's such a boring scene
I found more buoyancy in quarantine
Accommodations second rate
At least it's an environment that I can regulate
Like I was Warren G
I got a fan and bucket full of ice cubes
Fuck what's popping on the street
I gotta sweep up mice poo
I waged a war against the spiders and was left with the mosquitoes
But these blood suckers leave a bump
Those blood suckers always want to free-load
Yo, who's that peeking in my key hole trying to keep it on the d-low
Plain and simple, mine's my favorite simple mind
So I'm closing all the windows and I'm shutting all the blinds
Dum-diggy,
bump Biggie
Til the landlady holler, "Get a haircut, hippie"
The death knell generator entertain a fresh kill
Breath quelled dressed like a bloated sack of dead cells
Shedding, purple tape, purple 'hawk, ape
A single flower through the permafrost
Pick himself and learn to walk, in furry pants
War paint, circling a duralog
Boar face, devil by his side like a service dog
Schlock purist, watch the block burneth
One o'clock prophets in the parking lot at Perkins
The perfect politicians 30 clicks outside of Sturgis
Doggie bag doctors, military deserters
Who still shop surplus and can't hold jobs
I look like I'm wearing a ghillie suit when I'm not
Roll out ghost of Camu on the pegs
Might pedal by the police
Tuff with two F's

Ah fuck that shit look
Can't tell if I'm a little withdrawn
Or dead dog sent to quote/unquote "live on a farm"
The coke bottles tint film noir
Tripping out the milk bar
Poison horchata cup
Milf in the Zip Car
6 arms, 6 hand-styles like ships on scrimshaw
Part Def Jam part Dischord
My wig-picker threw me out of her office
Had to cold turkey 'benzos, summer was awesome
Onion of 'bensis
Summer was awesome
Got brats on the grill
Wormwood in the cauldron
Horse hoof in the dog's mouth
Cholera in the well
Make money periodically vomiting on himself
I read Nat Geo, craft and crack geodes
Lift party hats out of Craft Depot
Unleaded liar blood pumped through his neck
Came down from the mountain
Tuff with 2 F's

Bought the tape
I hope you bought the tape
I hope you bought the tape
I hope you happy with your purchase
I bought the tape
I hope you bought the tape
I bought the, bought the tape
I hope you happy with your purchase
I bought the tape
I hope you bought the tape
I hope you bought the tape
I hope you happy with your purchase
I bought the tape
I hope you bought the tape
I bought the, bought the tape
I hope you happy with your purchase
I bought the tape
I hope you bought the tape
I hope you bought the tape
I hope you happy with your purchase
I bought the tape
I hope you happy with your purchase

I boomerang styles 'round the
Y'all sweating beads praying someday you'll be the magnet
Poor pad of black magic and mass havoc
Where you in the shit but would much rather sleep detached in the madness
Plus your CD plays better as a coaster
We feel ignorant tonight
Delaying your flight, ripping your poster
Yo what you do on the mic?
What I'm supposed to
Write your face with raw raps
And fight they way out of the holster
Type of kid whom if I gave a week to build a house
You'd return with one brick in your hand
Claiming you're just a minimalist
Strike one, just an asshole
Let me amuse myself and step
How to make a sleeper wish he'd never slept
All's well
I'm high as fuck
The shameless exploitation of that Midas touch
I'm talking Iceman Cometh
Mic stands smacking the polite fans by the hundreds
Clustered up in green bunches
I would've been the idol of a nation made from higher limbs
But rusted ten seconds before my wingspan got to touch it
Now magazine's writing 'bout: "
Yo, you over-wordy cuz
"
But I'd let it roll off my back after they suck this dirty (?)
I'm a tomahawk whirling, circling early retirement
With death threats for the systematic Eucharist environment
Waddle back up to your block
And find yourself trapped between an atom
And an Ae-fucking-Sop RockDon't fool with his cool

I turn a staff to a snake and back,
evade crack
Shake a 5150 in shades and a fake stache
Dirtbike made of 5 worse bikes, uphill
Tabletop frames on dutch tilt,
crush kill
Maker bot coin-op arcade punk
Talkin' arcane science, dark age pulp
Four eyes carb face
,
Bar-Kays iron on
Pork rinds orangeade,
Jarred brains die alone
No Mulligans
,
crow bars bird cage
Cold, colonize Mars on Earth day
And surface from the cellar door like worms into the petrichor
Messenger, better yet a vessel for a Tetris score
Zilch
,
cowabunga
homies call me "press ignore"
Devastating energy exploding off his Tesla coil
Farm bated breath and tempermental tremors
That taught a man to wave with 10 percent of his fingers
And I never lost tic tac toe to a live chicken
For the footage, I'm off cam dynamite fishin'
For diamondback rattles in his holy grail
Evoke colony collapse via gross betrayal
3 wolf moon shirt, two shoes one sock
Wore the same hoodie everyday like Mumm-Ra
Buh-dum-bum
,
follow the regenerated rebel flesh
Out of sorts, out of water, suicidal tetrafish
Who stood by the conviction in his we should be together less forevermore
Before we are the severed heads of civil war
Invasive radio ricochet off the silver foil
Trash can fire looking for a kill to grill or spoil
Quickly, purveyors of fine hijinks
I know, this is why we can't have nice things
I prefer to skip the pleasantries
Flip the diner table, dip in time
for final jeopardy
No shit
Oh and don't fool with his cool
Ma, can we get a pool?
 Is that a no?

Okay, magpies, Hoarders, and allied forces
Who lick zig-zags being dragged by horses
Transcribe stories in patterns of pins dropping
Skinned boars and exaggerated limb-lopping
Slow Mozart, no I've never heard of knocking
Might've burst in on it, splits or skin popping
Opt out, sober on the eve of no saints day
Locate and aim for the token propane tank
Bang! Followed from a pulling of hair
To a homecoming sullied by a skull on a spear
It spun a human resources issue to public affair
Reciprocity is a pestilent compulsion to bear
And ultimately unfulfilling, concurrently that rigid upper lip and grudge are crippling
The wonder twins of bitching
Armchair hater, I wouldn't piss on your coffin
But when I see your picture I draw dicks on it
The Ozone breakaway tux
Holds chicken wire ribs and paper mache guts
Pipe cleaner mustache, rope hands google eyes
Macaroni gas face, no plan to humanize
You are now rockin' with the worst
Nothing up his sleeve, nothing here is what it seems
Paranormal weather, mysteriously disappearing bees
Not to mention the collateral delirium it breeds
Jeez, forgive him any dicey past
He from a tiny town called Deaths Icy Grasp
And he don't get out much, but when he do it's Beatlemania
Do not be asleep at the feet of his feelers radius
Too charitable, offerin' the average joe some real estate
Between the Big Mouth Billy Bass and jackalope
Cozy in a moment of bliss
Snatch the food off your plate, snatch a goat off a bridge
No shit
True crime, fantasy, action-adventure, game show
It's all sci-fi, I'm all Play-Doh
I like data that turn brains to egg yolk
It turn royals to regular John or Jane Does
I hate praising net worth over legwork
I hate ceding all power to the extroverts
I find the current social architecture hell on earth
We make shepherds and shadow 'em to the netherworld
I move
reticent
,
never really an open book
I'm gone fishin' at the risk of being overlooked
I know you love it when the novas open cobra hoods
A little show to get the focus off the cloven foot
Behind the curtain the Merlin is all jellyfish
I get to beckon the wrecking ball to your Lego brick
I wish you nothing but the gentle kiss of yellow piss
I give you nothing but the number for my exorcist

I was on the floor in a fugue state
Tripping over old flicks
Picking out a new name
I was on the couch feeling real gone
Learning how to walk from leaving the TV on
You could bear witness to the second first step
You could bear witness to the second first step
You could bear witness to the second first step
You could bear witness to the second first step

Romance, comedy, documentary, newscast
It's all cartoons,
I'm all smooth jazz
I seen a few that plotted futures over chewed fat
Abandon crew to collude with the common sewer rat
We value wrath above any accurate narrative
We let our most
irascible
design the characters
They only dressing they vendettas up as parables
Promoting privacy and cowardice as parallels
I got rid of the whip and told myself to boogie more
Invoke eternal disobedience in human form
Secure the city short an infantry and wooden horse
You missed the morning you were born to play the bugle for
I like glassy lake water and old maps
Tall tales with black sails and skull flags
Cold lemonade and
OG Golden Axe
I don't like to talk about the UFO CrashI pilot a lion heart
My polar halves negotiate it (right)
Shook upon the difference between tumbleweed and sacred
Read a hostel gospel attributed to land shark Apostle squad
Unfroze the hideous image like hostile plots
Bat up in the belfry (help me)
I wanna be the reinvention of fire
In a most stagnate tension basket
Fenced in a cognitive learning facility built by the makers of stinger repellent
But fresh as the active element
Bag of bricks roped to a Saturn atlas hooked to madness
And I swear my new fresh air till the goblin cried, "fuck the rabbits" and rose
Most soloists cannot defend the mighty kingdoms that their passages propose, that's why I am the rose
New day, new reign, same old
Aches and pains, same old
Emaciated frame game, same name
Spring water ain't enough anymore
I wanna see the river and bottle my own crystal drizzle liquid dinner
Well aren't we the phoenix of irritant method
Here to steer the flock out the farmland while every shepherd rested
With a, head on the wall
Of sovereignty's halls
I be the head shaker in a sea of nodding novelty dolls
Let's, crush the arena
Flush the pipe dreamer
Touch the skull of each and everything
Everything everything
I am a scarecrow
Bullied by the bullies
But the masters had 'em walking in circles like eye patches
Through the madness
One day, one rain
One cold, one poem
One way, one plain
One rose, one home
One strain, one pain
One fold, one zone
One element to many to made a hungry man moan
I'll be leavin now (I'll be leavin now) (it's not cool)
I'll be leavin now (I'll be leavin now)
I'll be leavin now (I'll be leavin now) (na-na nana na-na)
No I'll be leavin now (I'll be leavin now)
Everybody plug into the bludgeon
Follow your hunch and align the hunt collection
To count their blessings in abundance
Once in a crescent moon I'll adapt
To capture the essence's breakfast's participant's fishin' dissin' adventures
Heads gathered from every battered aspect of the march
To swap gossip
Who parted what sea? and
Who's hungry? and
Who's parched?
And it gets tiring wiring the populace an anti grin and list of accomplishments
Beyond basic. Residence
Stick figures stand at attention, deficit
And all's well that blends well with a warm hazardous combine
Thick as thieves are they?
I bully the wooly mammoth and champs
Germinate frantic decamped to the wino migration, examine
Eager to sport motley mosaic illustrate fallen pen-dragon
I'm from a pool flooded with punishment
I've seen drunken sailors pilot they vessels to split the light house
Laugh at brown bag liquor list on there way home from the blood bath
Half
angel with broken halo
; half primitive rugrat
Spoken for by wild life's hybrid mutations and slum cats
Doom for dominion sluggish posture
See I wait a lifetime just to
pierce these spears through the bellies of every monster
10 little warriors sit on a picket fence
Ordering themselves for protection of nonsense
Catapult the stone that struck the leader in the back and
Marked the beauty as the other 9 warriors worlds collapsed
Fuck the future
You cannot fuck the future, the future fucks you

Ground control to pilot
Ready?
Ready?

You a tough ass geezer
Give you props for that

Out of the ground, into the sky, out of the sky, into the dirt

What kind of effing a-hole would do something like this, Nancy?
I don't know, sir. Should I call the police?

Take that suckers! Ha ha ha

I'm dead, dead, dead as a door nail

Oh my god that's good

What do we become when we take th-the weakest in our society and we hold them up and we ridicule them? Laughed at for our sport and entertainment. Laughed at to the point that they would literally rather kill themselves than live with us anymore

I don't wanna go to bed
Well your mom said I had to put you to bed early because you've been sick. Now don't smart off to me
I wasn't sick. I just didn't like meatloaf

The sound. I-They just started going crazy and attacking each other when the alarm went off
I never don't float with the four winds
Sweat cold, piss warm, make war films
No doors on the forcefield, radio ahead
I log any palpitation of the web
Whether aphid or angel of death
Entertainment or threat
By the end, you're a savory crepe
Models that mar every orbit and corner, it's horrid
There's more exhibition than voyeur, oh boy
Cold dawn mist incarnate
Every day, I wake up in a different carcass
If I climb out quiet I'm myth before tea
I see no need to initial the tree
I seem to have run out of skin on my teeth
I look like I feel like a fish in a beak
I look like a dick in my picture ID
But also the pic isn't me, huh

Sideways rain that chew the zoo up
Okay losing a shoe in the mud
Okay losing a shoe in the mud
Okay losing a shoe in the mud
Sideways rain that chew the roof through
Home by twelve o'clock in two shoes
Home by twelve o'clock in two shoes
Home by twelve o'clock in two shoes

Break- Break- Break- Break- Break- Break- Break out
Break- Break- Break- Break- Break- Break- Break out
Break out with that bullshit money
Break out with that bullshit money
Break- Break- Break- Break- Break- Break- Break out
Break- Break- Break- Break- Break- Break- Break out
Break out with that bullshit money
That- That- That- That bullshit money

If he cultivate the grit that make a foal deface the brick
That make a bolt escape the fist
Some days on the road to make, he miss
And make the whole of the probe equate to piss
Blood rain, I'm a phase of the forecast
Storm through space like a blade through stored fat
Graze over the gate in the gore-fest
Ain't really play to the neighborly format
Great, baited adventuring out of his norm is a lesson in mapping the doors
Anything more in the lap of the gods
Anything less an imbalance ignored
Seems like even the ragtag grab bag
Raise eyebrows when your rat pack quack quack
Spitfires that kiss the pitch dark
He rows a big oar
He spins a grim yarn
I was at the gates
Ram's legs, my pizza black, my plants dead
My planet X, I might bleed green
I'm what's under the uncut chia seed
I'm what, what, what, what from the guillotine
A little flea and tick, a little fever dream
A little plead the fifth
Roadkill, I'm off leash
I don't heel and I'm hung from an unkind mobile
It turn one misstep into bonemeal
Look, daybreak, I'm lights out
My kind sleeps upside down
It's sci-fi, red tide, my hi and bye make record time
I go three, two, one, desensitize
No lie, tell death he could get in line
K, hellspawn, I'm no joke
I eat brains, I throw bolts
I know easy prey, I seen broken oaths
I go marching in, I'm all, "Oh-ee-oh"
I know a rodeo from these pony shows
I don't stay for tea, I can't slow the code, I go
Coyote, alone and ghost
I'm in the goddamn smoke, ear, nose, and throat
Ayy, yo, fresh pot, my favorite mug
Aes Rock, my day sucked
Agent of all things deep-sixed
I feel like I was put here to keep the crypt
I get tired of bread, I might eat the rich
I ain't seen a leader, just feeder fish
You want free weed, you want free shit
I mean, dude

I was at the gates
Wolf's head, my boots on, no bullshit
I know both sides of that tough love
They're both mud, that's what's up
That's what's up, that's what's up
Straight up and, straight up and down, don't even bother
I was at the gates
Snakeskin, my hood low, don't say shit
I know both sides of that bloodlust
They're both mud, that's what's up
That's what's up, that's what's up
Straight up and, straight up and down, don't even bother

Rat tail, my backdrop's all black sails
Dog bite and my bird curse
Cross-eyed, world's worst
Troglodyte, I might split the blinds
I'm like Vincent Van with that instant rice
I write cryptograms at all waking hours
I tattoo the mail and all paper towels
I'm on the kitchen walls, I may paint the house
It could breach the yard, it's omega-bound
Game face on dour days, y'all gang-gang's like, "How quaint"
Gangway for that false start vs. freight trains through stalled cars
Shame, shame, shit's so wack, show you back to this moth jar
Death wish from day one, I wake up and it rain blood
Raincheck these fuck shows, I'm donezo, my brain's mush
Drumroll, I might piss straight, loose tooth in my spit shake
Every possible Futurama come trooping out of his pill case
And I ricochet in my steel cage, one still heart and two hill's eyes
A few meal bars, a good field knife, I feel good, no field guide
Just deicide by tea at five
Once ate a whole gluestick in like two bites
I do this, I mean, yo
Get up to get down now
Get up to get down now (like this)
Get up to get down now (like this)
Get up to get down now (alright)
I don't wanna do it anymore
Couldn't do it if I tried, wouldn't do it if I wanted it
Hey
I don't wanna do it anymore
Couldn't do it if I tried...

Okay, the moments were subtle, but unstolen, and guess who owns them?
No friendly, non-threatening corporate, lacky-mucks, in the totem
Lucy was In the Sky with Diamonds,
five dollars to hold 'em
The summer, Van Eek beat Pac-Man, with acid behind his molars
Little white tab tolerant, little white flag, waggling

Good Morning Vietnam!
Whose couch is this? Whose house is this?
Who are you down with bitch?I'm sorry, dog, I dreamt the foulest shit
There was this rabbit foot talisman, drowning out of my arm-span
What's fouler, was the other farmhand's growing gills, and shark fangs
What's fouler, was my torso stripped to ribbons, in the marshlands
But I'm up now
Let's get this window pane, and shut the fuck down
Down by the river, where the litter sits -
And lion-heart critters, smoke dope, and act like illiterates
I ran with a brat pack of loose bolts, and high social maladjust-ees
Sacred, numb and boundless went to St. Protocol, cut me, well -
I was dummy to some, when the tongue was cradled, and my skin looks crazy

This one's for the
Labor Days
, work for rent and rolling papers
Only the illest beats leak absurdly out the boombox
The Daytripper anthem goes: wake, drop, walk to aquarium
Whistle while you work, like a canary lung,
"All work -And no play makes Jack a dull boy", to carry drugs
I sorta see it, as my last blast in summer (Uhn!)
Skateboards and sloppy psychedelics and big numbers
Good times, good people,
all airbrushed -
On a collapsible easel
, peace man, easyReeeeeemix!
...Throw your babies in the air

Dead men tell no tales (Uh-huh)
Up push the daisies till the soil is stale
In a powder blue tux for the farmer's sale (Here we go)
Mr. Big sleep with the carp and kelp

Once upon a time in the days of yore
When the people lived fresh outta legend and folklore
There was an old pirate who piloted vile slang
Had a bird perched on him and swash buckled the same
Peg leg navigate him starboard to port
By the nautical starry night yelling "The harbor is yours!"
And you should tell them where you situate the gold
That is unless you'd like a vacation with Davy J-J-J-Jones
Like "walk the plank" for whom the shark thank
Maroon the mutineers consume the souvenirs
And while the shiny spoils piled higher every year
He was suffocating slow in the box of a buccaneer
Ten summers prior on a night like this
Crows nest scopes something afloat to the boats west
Swore it blew him a kiss
When he focus seen the face of an angel upon the body of a
F-f-f-fish
"What the heck!" frazzled, his telescope shattered
Gathered himself she was ghost he was down the rope ladder
To deck
circled the vessel 360 swiftly
Found nothing in the water but salt, piss and whiskey
Yarr, heckled by the swabbies at the bar
He'll be the laughing stock of the Barbary Coast War
Like this dude either got two glass eyes
Or he wearing his patch on the wrong s-s-s-side
Now he knew what he saw
But had to prove he was raw
So he raped and he pillaged and
And he feud and he brawled
Try to rekindle his rep via sabers and gun smoke
And vowed to always find her though he never told his cutthroats
(Hey!) Meanwhile, back in the now
Got a brand new skeleton crew on the move out
When they aren't manning thirty burning cannons stern and bow
They are prying shiny metals out your m-m-m-mouth
Okay, youth wanes old age holler wisdom and disease
Like the scurvy made his yellow gums bleed
And he was achy from his boots to the feather in his hat
Until his quartermaster showed up with a stolen treasure map
One look down and lept off the dock
See if you can guess where X marked the spot
The capital was buried at sea in a cursed cave
Only one mile from where he'd seen the mer-mer-mer-maid
Anchors up, hoist the jolly roger thank you much
Day and night with his hook hands raised and clutched
But see the vitamin deficiency was strong
So by the time they bumped into the island he could barely lift his grog
Crawled off the boat, collapsed in the sand
Prayers in the air, seashells in his hand
And nary a high tide so grand as the one that put
The lady of the lake on dry la-la-la-land
I wish I could tell you that it ended happy
Pretend like his bones weren't practically snapping
Pretend like her gills didn't dry up and suffer
But that's a half-dead pirate and a fish outta water
No lie, scout's honor, got a million more
From the burgundy lighting above the shores of whores
Before your visions of grandeur go to swell those sails
Remember dead men tell no t-t-t-tales

No more pencils, no more books
I built the city out one brick
It had a mayor and a crook
I made the crook stab the mayor then slay himself in the guilt
I stole the brick back and migrated east, now, let's build

Every tenderfoot cadet bettered slit-throat percentages
Chicken penmanship tied the thirteenth knot (Hangman)
I arrange panoramics of a placid cataloguing where wild dogs sing tailor-made lullabies tried by my offspring
I'll bring the butterflies and he can bring the centipedes
And she'll bring the cadavers set 'em free and let 'em feed
The deviltry penciled me in, but I slept thick through my alarm clock
Silly Billy hid in the barn while farmer charmed the crops
And I'm a warden
My tongue is full of glass
Because I promised my friend I'd chew up the bottle
If he truly drank the poison
I'm alienating the mating dance of the higher, ire-based, tired-faced, miser-made God clones
We can manufacture medicine
Patent the five digit slide clock the essentials in (I'll be a bill collector)
My destiny's resting with red worms chewin' off the carcass anyway
Let me slay artists for tips in the penny tray
By the way if that diamond ring don't shine
That's cause I bought it at the five-and-dime but don't neglect the sentiment
I'll pedal my tricycle through the F-5 logistics of a twister
Soaked in the religions of a nit-picker
You can read along with me in your book
You will know it is time to turn the page when you hear the chimes ring like this
Let's begin now

Yeah
Watch
(It's)
The world's greatest thing ever thung
(It's)
The saccharin that the sit on your tongue
Fill up his clip-on tie repellent
Squeegee to semi-developed
While you were sleepin' he's building Rome in his cellar
I'm too alive right now
The view to which you subscribe
Find the key to parry blockage of the cubicle kind
I had a plate of half cooked matters looking at me stupid
Fed 'em to the hogs that waddle between the bookends
Look, clear!
All I gotta do is:
Simply make the greatest masterpiece ever conceived by human students
Once I am convinced that the kismet inside the labor
Is already incredible I might as well ink the paper
Hell yes!
Easy-peasy, right?
Sure. Hey, whatever makes the hazel glaze well
I sink teeth deep in to the chart with a fang but for a hark
'cuz even silly pink bunnies look scary in the dark!
Bang on pots and pans, ring alarm swiftly
Cue to bugle turbulent, who salute the worker ant?
Duke up to the firmament, overthrow the vapors
With a fail-safe method composed by your nosy neighbors
Like this:

Smack dab in the middle of his palms
Had a new day victory, ready to evolve
Who will celebrate and sleep on the couch
To later wake up in the second best seat in the house

(It's) The world's greatest thing ever thung
Except the last digit, pink in your lung
I'm on a genius plan, author the marvel of engineering to rival the great pyramids and cheese in a can
He's in a band called "Birds" in a work of assertive poplars
With a root down deeper than the pockets on his doctors
So selfishly melt through the piss of Hades
As to never note the critics, shake the hands or kiss the babies
So the ratings through the chapel roof
And snaggle-tooth is focused outside of the jurisdiction of failure among the motives
Just when the victory is comfortably assumed
You will be woken by the creaky hinge of door number two
Door number two, it's sorta like a silhouetted whore in plain view
When your homework is due
Rhinestone cowboy, nursing his little phenom
As an even newer idea poke its head out for recon
Oh what a weird distraction, all of a sudden you're lugging separate chapters
Original mission is bliss and all
But this admittedly is somewhat attractive, even if a little backwards
Unrealistic as it sounds
I want each picture that I'm working on to be
The only picture that I'm working on
To go a bit further, the only picture
That I've ever worked on
And to go even a bit further
The only picture that anyone has ever done
My new fall coat got strange powers
When I'm with it I know I am not the same without it
I like to zip it all the way up 'til I'm only eyes
I wear it when I'm dipping in and out the flow of time

My swerve circle toughies
I learn em, and return to "good for abso-smurfly nothing"
We buddies when ya need a beaver hat to birth a bunny
Any other day it's heed the curse and don't disturb the mummy
Disturb the mummy
I've heard it turn your Monday into bright lights hovering over crop circle country
Slow clap when your cold facts capsize
Soul clap through your last rites
Chew gum from "we're losing him" to flatline
And that's life, not to be a dagger through your bagpipes
Strike another match with no sensation in my feelers
This is too much information, breaking plates and taking t-birds away
He flees Rome between seizures
Still talking grease, launching tees into bleachers
Take him to your leader's leader's leader
Even the redeemer like "I need to speak to senior", ey!

Every dollar you bury under a tree
All the art that inform how you speak
Little black books stacked to the beams
It all falls into the sea

Shoebox full of photos from the scene
All the nothing you been stuffing up your sleeve
More stuff than you possibly need
It all falls into the sea

If a single point of light off in the distance got you fuddy-duddies tripping
You should see me when I'm colors from the prism
I don't know if you're busy, but the bunker we resist in got a cupboard full of skulls
You'd make a wonderful addition, listen
I could back a nail out from the inside
Scratch through the lid and dig a tunnel toward the wind chimes
It's time, any plan to track and split the bounty turn to sand
When mother ain't around to kiss the owies
I show up uninvited, break a chair and drink the lava lamp
All you see is fire and karate on the body cam
Golly you're a docile bunch, I'm ushering that posse out the poppy plants
This is my Jumanji not your Zombieland
Probably eat a couple fingernails, but otherwise
Did it all pretending I'm not seeing trails
Known for taking 5 to stick my tongue out in the autumn rain
That's just how I auto save
Four rooms, a ceiling and a floor but there's more
(Close to insanity)
A desk with a subtle light, a window, and a door
(Close to insanity)
One bottle of the bluest inks your iris ever saw
(Close to insanity)
One child prodigy with a vision in his core
(Close to insanity)

I'm frost bitten, slippin' away titanic burden nurses
Where the anti-hero clergy purge their value burning service
And warped was I, huddled beneath the influence of fresh
Meshed with impressions that appear to shrink before my very breath (Breath)
These tides of woe and malice and mirth initiate a wave crash
Splashing my offspring graves prior to birth, it's looking bleak (Bleak)
Malarkey farce sergeant crooked and sleek emerald eyes glow
I'm shook in a freak side show!
OK, I strobe effects projective when I blink, so I design this chorus line
When linked we let our eyelids fall and pilots stall
With what I sing, I'll open lash light and dark clash to dim the wattage
Then see the wide-eyed dried raising supplied fiery Colossus
Well, I am a hostage, guiding, yet, pushed beneath the craze's climate
Hiding behind the levy while the stubborn rivers rise and feel this
I wish heavenly brevity centered hate pedigrees instead of dead serenity
God damn, must have remembered me
It clenched me, it wrenched me, tempted me to employ it
Apprehended me and rendered me suspended in its voyage
How these tables have turned!
Hand to the bottle with the skull and crossbones scribbled off the label, sip the ladle, drank the burn
Begging for death
,
concerns off with a zephyr tread and leg in a web
Caught triple-six couriers; beckon, they fled
OK, OK, I get it; let 'em shake a little, then release 'em
Like, as if ghostly hysterics would leech on band aid completion
Odium
,
patience ran his anti-death commando
Just a litigant stretchin' to touch tranquil, but couldn't quite catch the angle
(Yeah)
I'm trained as cornerstone famine trooper
So my tray within a heart of hearts still belly up and parched
, come on (Yeah, yeah, check it)

I'm a sideline observer alerted not yet retreating
(Close to insanity)
The climate stubbornly hovered slightly above freezing
(Close to insanity)
Now everybody in the populace awaited my reply
(Close to insanity)
I spit a billion tiny brilliant white lights into the sky
(Close to insanity)

Undeniably amused by the way the fuse burn
By the way the clues churn in front of my eyes
To fertilize germination of concern for me, for we
For he who's sucked into the trench, fully dug, I don't wanna pull the plug
Hug on my canteen like in a dream
Centipede leader speedin' through a meaty greed league
I can tell by the way the needs bleed from a seed
If the breed should have ever been bred, 'nuff said
Whether compared to caterpillar and cocoon to emerge
Or a spark's soon to bloom to a surge
All I need is the nourishment, the courage and the burn
To ascend from a number, to brave Blade Runner
Hunter, cleric, swordsman, king
More like I'm walking with a broken mood ring
Mood swingin' from the mezzanine level, here to bevel the edge
My team's settled on the ledge to pledge, it's like thatI could make 'em all dance, or I could sleep
I could walk with a limp and make your step feel incomplete
People are made of match sticks, light this bread a flames
Note at the craft work door the last smirk of the the Damien mainframe
My box cost siphon third rail juice from lost poets
Inhabit ocean bottoms with a bitter rotten scapegoat pardons (note to self)
Don't bargain at martyr parliament rallies
Where participants squeeze your last giggle then whittle sacrificial finalies
I can tie my boot laces alone, save your knee deep offerings
Sorta bring puke coughing bunk persona to light (I might)
Build malignant(?) railroads, find you, and lay tracks adjacent
Just to scream "fuck off" as the engine pulls out the station
What should we do with a thousand drunken sailors?
"kill 'em all, locate their family address, release a mailer"
(dear sir or madam, your son or daughter's embarrassed human kind
Consuming booze and gut fuel, till they cruised across the line)
I spin gold, your raps are dirty lapsed
Towards the nursery class act impression of a bubble
(yeah I could of been more subtle when polluting paradise gene puddle)
Yeah huddles make us look like cool peeps and I'm trying to school sheep
Towards the right idea 
This basic divine subsidiary bust center syllable logic, fold origami
Plantation shut this picket fence
Hang on to your dreams kitten, you'll probably never hear this song
Let alone sip the mission long enough to listen
(I can smoke cigarettes down to filter, smoke the filter down to space
Now I'm gonna roll this question tight and smoke that shit up in your face
Now if you were to alter masks every time fame circus approaches
Do you really think your maker wouldn't notice?)
Okay, I've died a thousand, and I'll die a thousand more
I leave footprints in fours, two for bipeds, two more to break the door
Practically caress the utterings of crushed by drudgery(?) brothers and sisters
Mothering stickler cabin and madden shit
I'll fix the wing for a penny and a parabole, yeah but this friendship
Sunk with a barrel full of taros pull
Snake eyes harbor bad shiners
Then wonder why the culprits sitting at the their rainbows ending
Want's garbage bag liners (??????)
With out the apple seed it's useless (I sat for greed)
Patched for boredom crafts a castle out of toothpicks (I sat to breath)
I breath to hard nearly metamorph castle loose pins
Now I stand to breath as not to disturb the plumage
And I know that's not a story, it no longer turns my stomach
Hollering wolves in the form of one frustrated culprit
But a love tap full of washed up stardom melted trying to milk it
Win a ticket to ride white lines highway sideways melt it smelt it
One love to the rungs in my ladder, one love to the gathering of
Laughter bats that hung from my rafters
See the jackal met the badger, they were both such fucking bad asses
That clashing wouldn't make sense (hence my tape deck)
Now I ain't gonna name name's, and I ain't gonna drag others in
But I ain't about to say that I'm the only cat you got bubbling
You're lucky, somehow you managed to befriend some good people
Who will sit and soak the evils you secrete, but why? I'm not really sureOh my God
They've got angels sweatin' like Helots
Workin' their little halos to the bone combing them deserts
My figure eight knotted
Lifeline
defined traffic
The way my schoolin' end-less-ly defined every day
One exquisite fitted crisis rivets an octagon of red
To the ceiling above my bed
It's not a conversation piece, like public spectacles
Unleashed more of a clue
So when I wake up to the reigns I'll be one step ahead of you
I slide like Kodachrome
Wrote a poem for every planet
Tracked their mileage from the sun in an envelope
Licked it, stamped it
Got eight thank yous in the mail, but nine planets means there's one left
Only the earth would thank me later with a breath taking sunset
(man, I'm just a bum)
Zip that waterfall around your skeleton
Tell it to boil
Loyalties, the shovel in the soil
Dig it,
I split my lip kissing the winter
Nursed the blister in the sun
Strung a hammock between spring and where the willows turn to blood
Might of worked
Sip a little, litter it, love it
Without big beetles trying to sell him sunflower seeds by the bucket
Might of, tugboat for the boxcutter above those ashes
Without hot air balloons floatin' their four passenger baskets
And I'm asking you
To let a captive lacerate a caption
Splash out massive
Upholster plastic classes with famine patches
I-dentify all saints linked around the fountain's warmth
And for a second taste of pain when removing that crown of thorns
Anatropic motley clique mockado, born hostile,
pacifist huddled in subtle masochist
Stamp the blame on following an inkling
My fire escape overlooks ghost town market place
Martyrs barter passes
Then fast themselves to the target's face
You're killin' me
If I had a hammer
,
I'd build a city on stilts
So my feet would stay dry when God's wine glass tilts
If I had a shovel, I'd dig a hole in the dirt
And I'll be hiding when his drunken stupor lands upon earth
And if your little wing is broken
I'll see the poacher in hell
I can't afford another
anti-burden soldier to cell
My carousel mimics the interests of a thousand leaking spigots
And a colony of graziers
raised to justify the grimace
(and yes I read the treaty)
I prescribed brevity plus the premise is my pin cushion
My limbs pushin' the knitting needle
Evils, idle, peddle past the greeting
Where the sleepers feed the cycles
Stop, watch the eagles board
the little engine that could not
Ghost in a shell
And it fell in my lap
Passion posted the bail but the guard had misplaced the key ring (that's wonderful)
I lead a fleet of blazing
Zaxxons
directly into the village
Power supply burning the bridge between the magnet and my eye
Now how many cadavers satisfy a mad man?
And how many crooked samaritans turn plesantville to bad land?
I can count my own dusty nickels with you laughing
About you'll turn my poor ass ebony and navy with cane lashings
(well, you're right)
Grip your pointed stick
, incite your riot
I'll sell your worth in a bottle, let profit explain my bias
Atomic box cult, downward spiral rapidly
Cast to hell with hate mail,
forged Christ's autograph
Laughed itself, drastic catastrophe
Biting my lip
Skin and bones, stringent
Bingin' on rancid baits
Mummified well inside a muddy New York minute
Was it
Your remnants my smoke rings have cocooned prior to fading?
Well, it wasn't conscious spite but it might have been thatI could make 'em all dance, or I can sleep
I can walk with a limp and make your step feel incomplete
People are made of match sticks, life is bred of flames
Noted the craft work bore the last smirk of the Damien mainframe
My boxcar siphons third rail juice from lost poets
Inhabit ocean bottom with a bin of rotten scapegoat pardons
Note to self:
Don't bargain at martyr parliament rallies
Where participants squeeze in last giggle then widdle sacrificial finales
I can tie my bootlaces alone, save the knee deep offerings
Sorta brings you coughing bunk persona to light
I might, Build anti-malignant railroads, find you, and lay tracks adjacent
Just to scream "fuck off" as the engine pulls out the station
What should we do with a thousand drunken sailors?
"Kill 'em all, locate their family address, release a mailer:"
(Dear Sir or Madame, your son or daughter's embarrassed humankind
Consuming booze and gut-fuel, till their cruise had crossed the line
)
I spin gold
He bats a dirty lash toward the nursery class act impressionable bubble
(
Y'all could've been more subtle when polluting paradise gene puddle
)
Man, huddles make us look like cool peeps
and
I'm trying to school sheep
Toward the right idea, see ya
This basic divine subsidiary buffs gunner syllable logic, fold origami
Plantation shut
Does this picket fence hang on to your dreams kitten?
You'll probably never hear this song
Let alone sip the mission long enough to listen *acapella*
Jiggy-jabberjaw vitamin idol and primal rages
When bible page verse tidal waves begun
(Water won)
I wrote the book that shook America to splinters
In a winter wasteland icicle-bound barren township
Call Baron Münchhausen and proud gimps to clinch this chemical war pig
Delinquent sinking like a paper tugboat well beneath your holidays
Beached on a red tide infested shore corroding eastern seaboard beauty
I'm a jigsaw slab, but all the pig saw was dirt bag
It's like a bleeding comet bombing on your sequels
To the Riverside Park Tunnel people claim last lifeform standing
Carbon based pardons ain't enough
My stilts truly personify this urbanite flea circus
We urchins merkin on daily
I catapult brain opera past basic
Tear my own face off in the finale, stick around it's ill
Diabolic Prodigal Son spill grimmace
If you had one more eye, you'd be a Cyclops
Which explains missing the premise
Bliss mimic, baptise, chastise, laugh, die
Kiss the finish, piss the villagers the fuck off
Pete Piper picked peppers, and Run rocked rhymes
Aes Rock might've smoked one too many dimes in his time
Now, where you gonna be when the sun falls, brother?
Probably gathering your sheep with all these other motherfuckers
Struck twice in the same place by a moody Zeus fishliner
Smackin the third clear out the park
Going gone (To infinity and beyond!)
I rocked for a flock of Chewbacca look-alikes in magic makers
Hermit crabs and New York city sewer aligators
Keep your Honalee dreams out your homily
I deal with tangible goods
And avoid manufacturing food for landfills
I've seen friends bow to needles
I've seen needles bow to records
I've seen boughs break
I've seen God bow and make the clouds shake
I've seen the proud break
I've seen a lot for a blind soldier
Who tattooed a cityscape on skin to blend in
The rats travel by night and fight the waterbugs
I'm here to pull the three-prong on this prime directive wormhole of self-sacrifice
Add a hatchet slice for kicks
And so that God-awful Frankenstein scar on your style can someday be a story for my kids
Life's hard, life's easy
Life's everyting in between
Life's Peachy like James and the Giant
And I keep spittin as long as these kittens buy it
And I keep casting my line as long as these fish will bite it
And I like it (Don't try it like that)

"Yes the bough is low
That's the way it goes though....
Maybe I should just give up or stop trying
But life is so uncertain, so short
I've got to keep on searching
And wherever it takes me, I've got to go"

Bantamweight temper tantrum, decrepit anthem
Set a low goal, I arrive late
I'm here to scrape a cog clean till the funk machine
Imposes on the underling amalgam cluster and identifies the mother
(Oh you got heart?)
I hate to tell you but it skips more than it palpitates
Like these here drunken little archers miss more than they calculate
The falcon hates the mockingbird
The farmer hates the drought
I hate em all, I kick the bottom brick out shouting "Yes y'all"
And blow the village out perspective (Aesop!)
Do you take this makeshift Candy Land cult-classic bastard style
To be your lawfully wedded head trip
To embrace throughout sickness, health, electrical storm
Fire, pain, rain, hail, wind, ice, sleet, snow? (Hell no!)
I'm balanced, personified phantom to the bone
Walkin like a Jabberwocky
Scalpin a pair of one-way tickets to shadowboxing
It's just like Christmas with a shallow stocking
Like this (I'm just trying to milk the mileage)
You drop science like Don Herbert with liquor in him
Soundin' off like senior citizens sitting at Bingo parlor bickering
Yeah, it's kinda funny, isn't it?
How I can build while you just sit there and bitch about your syllabus
I am not doomed (not doomed)
I burn bridges, not spoons (not spoons)
But I only burn the bridges, hitchin' life in locked rooms
Passive obstacle assessment:
Bound to blossom festive knock on wood
Salute the little lonely troglodyte that could
So they navigate the blame game with a bulls-eye on a gold link wrapped around shrink-wrapped persona
Honor in a makeshift crooked thug version of sacred
Not to be mistaken with the purity with which my angel masons storm the basement
Rope ladder descends from mothership, c-sectioned, monstrous
While a billion babies build forts out refrigerator boxes
Burrow, for the too far gone platoon craft billy clubs out fallen apple tree trunks
After apple seeds sunk well beneath them
My style sits softly in a synapse between fairytale and logic
Primarily Agnostic
Idle while the tidal title deem heat waves worthy of swallowing your journey
Wallowing across the nursery
I arrive tardy. I've offended every last pedestrian
Upon my way over to bless that bar seat
There's no excuse, I know, I'm sorry, but I'm here
 Which is more than I can say for my love of these puppeteers
 Well they tug 'em all in perfect syncopation, make they mommas proud
Certified absurd prince of flattery
Product of a drunken, rhythm-driven faculty
Check a mortal mayhem discotheque, boogie with a bounced check and a cigarette

I prick my finger on a thorn bush, picking you a lilac
You can water it with your envy and burn it with your livestock's
I guess you can come on my trip, why not?
Tie knots in our existence and marry-go-round your holy tripod
For every single flame the imploding sky drops
I cross the burned bridge of syringes ? by lyrics ? cyclops infinitely focused on moving this ice block
I could of land a nice job, but I plan to fight God
Understand I might stop at nothing, short of order distorted by torched porcelain images of man
My glands are quite dormant coordinated with porous
Won't forfeit my stance and transmission if I hit the right knob
Fright clot, numbs the thumb, run and stir the rice pot
The anger that hovered kept me in a tight lock
I'm parallel with every line Jesus Christ thought
Leaving heaven frozen
, rolling a seven on this dice shot

Slow down, float showdown at the show
Minnesota to Manhattan until it gets broken loose
Holding you immobile to show you what we're going through
And ain't nothing changed and the rent's still overdue
Still hate the rappers that speak through the mean mugs
Ain't got no bite but you bark like a tree trunk
That shit doesn't flush
 And every pipe is plugged
 I know you're loving us (you ride the nuts like the dick was a bus)
Now hold tight, your whole energy doesn't flow right
It's enough to make me wonder if you prefer to just blowpipe
We're this close to giving you hoes a good choke
Clowns thinking they're profound man, they're not even a footnote
I walk around the world like a malnourished tourist
A refugee, caught between the referee and the purist
Circuits overloading, cyborgs about to explode
Release the little man inside my tired soul
Somebody must have let the lion out the cage
And got him high before he climbed up on the stage
Cause here I am again, glossy-eyed, topsy-turvy
And this is just another pitstop on the journey
Most of ya'll don't even inspire me to diss you
So caught up in the politics, forgot to kick the issues
Slug, call me Se7en
, ya'll know what I'm about
Now close your fucking mouth, before my balls fall out
In the district called the Barbary Coast
Nickelodeon showed scandalous moving pictures
The coast was described by one indignant critic
As "that sink of moral pollution, whose reefs
Are strewn with human wrecks
Here, blear-eyed men drink vile liquor
Smoke offensive tobacco and engage
In vulgar conduct. Here are:
Debauchery, disease, insanity, blasphemy, death
And hell, yawning to receive its putrid mass."
(The ground shook, and the sky burned...)

These are the unregulated rabbit holes
Barrack homes and taverns built for devil's acre
Opium enthusiasts and baritones, marigold
The garish allure of the burning Barbary
Underbelly born of 40 thieves in whorish harmony
Hammering for the dark and heartless
Harpy, shark and harlot argue breathing room
Do not let the arson jeeper-creeper you
If we elect the scenic route see it as greener grasses
Like morphine after snatch help you forget diseases matter
Not to mention 15 cents for either weakens cheaper gamblers
Down for hell inside a melting pot
No one's ever melting they just yell a lot
Stab each other, drink and eat and belly-flop
Murder Point, your thoroughfare at 12 o'clock
Is hell and back, EMB to Chinatown
Kearny clashing cutters out the netherworld
Sydney ducks to pistol fuck the centerfold
Every cellar iniquity, pretty killers and pistol petes
Might wake up to horses tearing at your limbs symmetrically
[Chorus: Aesop Rock and
EL-P
]
Tomorrow morning when the wharf is finished warping
You will wash up on the shore and wonder what was so alluring
Tomorrow evening when the leeches finish feeding
You'll regret the ownership of an aorta that is bleeding
Who stole the uprock, who stole the paint?
Who stole the cypher slayers,
who buffed the train?
Who stole the mixtapes,
who stole the fame?
Who stole the cypher slayers,
who buffed the train?

Barnacle on the hull of show business
Vote for auto dead horse battery
Murder perfect world Gerber Baby ecosystem
Army green eyes with ColecoVision bash casually
While punks jump up and jeopardize my head banger reality (ah)
Godzilla jook
Red five minus the whiny Wookiee
Gobble gromits with a jaw that swivels backwards off the hinges
Mollasses  on plastic fabric with a cause
That riddles bastard coughs with ribbons
Nerve-wracker that pivots
As a dysfunctional dancer in the dark
My smart bomb mechanism ticks adjacent to the broke city
Art yester-vision
I'm mister God Bless the Mission who rose to expose your tarot
And stop the ball club kids on ?stoner?
(How about a little fire scarecrow)
But brainiac dumb-dumb, bust the duck hunter
I let the fuckin' dogs out and they're breeding in big numbers
It sorta' irks citizen exes and vexes check collectors
Hexed by the flex of a messy pegasus
Remarkable but unmarketable
Leg'go my treasure chest
It's empty, but I use it to cradle my true confessions list
Confession one:
Aesop was raised to the Colonel Kurtz daycare center
For disgruntled youths where it's brilliant to flee the sheep flock
You're a little teapot homie please don't feed the pigeons
They're tryin' to spread their peacock feathers
And bleed through the system
This goes out to plainclothes prophets
Free for the wisdom
Who swore they'd never spend a night and sleep in the pigpen
Touch the prickly outer shell of reptilian
Minimal nighttime Z-catcher
20,000 league mapper
, and um
Me and my primitive friends drag our knuckles
And find your upright bipedal walking ugly
(I'll be in the back evolving from a monkey)
Thanks to y'all that came to school with paint stains on your fingertips
And brought a little life to those Long Island railroad city trips
Please, remember I can build you my friend
And if I'm not happy, I'll break you the fuck down and build you again

Who stole the uprock, who stole the paint?
Who stole the cypher slayers,
who buffed the train?
Who stole the mixtapes,
who stole the fame?
Who stole the cypher slayers,
who buffed the train?

I drag my alligator belly to the brake light (Hi)
And drag my alligator belly back to bed until I die
You've got a metal skull with wires through your heart and a dead air surplus
(Ludicrous)
Like Labor Days bootleggers on some support the movement shit
My practice: life inside a pitch black magic pack of rat brackets
That's tragic
?Bout to head back? to out for a pack of rat bastards
That's an earthworm mentality, flag captured
Peaceful: telling me that ?Aes speaks? proudly
On a soulful with an idle motor
They say decrepit
Is where I'm at
Sinful like a brain full of bottle rockets
Not a model, not a prophet (nope) not ?undone?
Got a fuckload of missions here want 'em
You can tell your man they came to you in a daydream
And I won't rally back, alley cat (Passion)
One tall glass (action)
Taller glass for the (aspirin)
Balderdash (backspin)
Back track, back in effect, back in the clutch
Sittin' on this old '98 BFA collecting dust
Slack-jawed, smiling like a hacksaw, that's raw
Spit master conspirator feeder for critics to suck
You're off track betting on a one-trick pony
With pony express delivery delay effect, funny
No, that's not funny
City yard slaughtered ugly
With pins needles and duck-walks busted
Sitting at the movies with a large bucket of Xanax
Extra butter and a spring water
Kamikaze Zaxxons
Flight simulator major
Street pilot directly through the iris
Fuck it, freak the fader on some fly shit
You replicas overlooking the guidelines of acoustics
Miserable attempts result in miserable conclusions
Paragon Pendragon tactician on free-form
That uncomfortable, silenced pride of combat cliques
That unexpected zephyr, the cyclone shifts
Worked up, you're shooken. Jutted to the side
I stagger this vagabond wandering minstrel forms your phobia
Worst fear. The terror-stricken muted
The roots of all evil I've rooted pinnacle
Poised with pride pouncing to break your stride, forsaken
Agony rides inside the heartache wretched condition
My intuition felt you slip up
You tripped alone what are you aiming for?
Or the useless tries to classify your genus, distorted fetus
Evolve, type unsolved, you lack the malediction
Malleable martyrs get molded, then folded under pressure
Dowsed with scenes of slaughter suspension
Bridge over troubled water drown, sound study intensive
My square drops to erase your lines like Tetris
Relentless agent hush horrendous circles on my pavement
Two sticks to burn basics that lie adjacent to my placement
On the game board, lunge forward and wind up impaled by the same sword
Choose your weapon, stains splattered upon your flag
Tattered rag shielding the exterior inferior
Stall face to face with a forms that force your downfall
Admittedly suspicious of your cadence, your network's on hiatus
Permanent, provoked and choked upon the potency
The peril be the penetrating agent pierce the insights
Why the cold sweats at midnight? Why the dim light?
Why are we staring at a truth from the inside?
Why the pen slide with vigor on a put down?
Like why'd I put my foot down stomp your city
A-E-S-O-P scoping through the myrth, opening minds behind the smirks

Only in my sweetest dreams do my streams lack troubled waters
Babbling brooks with babbling crooks
Only in my sweetest dreams do my streams lack troubled waters
Shallow pools full of shallow fools

I've seen misery, I've seen disgust dust ridden ruins
Ironclad oracle test recon unit disperse silently
Over confidence leads to irony
Plot twist foolhardy Icarus shifted in facets of my form
Forbidden aspects of the swarm a thorn upon your side
A storm upon the rise, Adam, ire crush come brush upon the red zone
Crook you're shook you started poorly
Your powers parted pace uncharted territory
Disoriented malicious bar you'll burn your bridges
This craft requires first drafts
Graphs, gritted blueprints of nemesis perimeter
Hunting by night compute, twenty one mic salute
One life polluted, concerned muffle moans
From the nine rings of Donnie's hell burn you in your slumber
Sleepwalk then pulled under now
Whipping through the willows is the warden of this garden
Slipping through the silhouetted skylines Aesop sidewinds jaded
Don't wind up war painted into the jungle the solution's not intrusion
The starving institution broke your mainframe
I pose the question, are these waiting games worth it or worthless?
While I comb the crowd for clues your naivety hands be my purpose
Our planet is the pivotal point
In which this network slowly turns to filter kicks
We out-box the berserk bewildered by the wilderness
My clench is frantic clutch manners falling through underbrush
Touch fools that duel with a dominant
The evil-minded tried to triple six me but he missed me
Intervene; emcees appear as red blips on my color radar screen
Yo, broken glass everywhere
Aesop Rock pissing flares on city staircases next to the base heads
Follow holographers spitting crowd mayhem simulation
To feed ego blood arraigned, then launch operation food chain
Sleepwalkers pile at the eyelets down (flash vipers)
So they catch a bad one like one eyed graf writers
Its utterly stunning inside the great escape chase where
Kitchy snitchers crowd outside clouds of suspicion like
"I'm one look in the first place"
They capcorder certified A-1 blue ribbon sucker pride
To be preserved mammoth out glacier, run away by prize
With broken dignity
These wooden wings got Geppetto jealous
But when a boy may detect every lie, "I can fly"
Looky here we the digital hyena click serpents (surface)
I'm a third straight citizen, stellar
Caught up in, no
Brought up in a cripple triple six lidagin cellar
Where under a creaky step huddled to scorn of
this
old yeller
Yes, you feeling that?
Maybe they didn't understand the ramifications encased in the new Blockhead dental plan
Hit it squirt
Run of the litter
Warpin' morsel
Camper
Mommy's little helper
Pumpkin
Puppy dog, I'd fuck up suck trouble
Tractor
Mix your little pigtails Mr. worst version of burden born dead
I'm over your product
Your living existence is but a wing nut on the training wheels
A bitch called politic cycles
Idolizing germ breeding and worm bibles
Impossible Kid,
4/29
Just some shit

Three's company, Appetite for Destruction tee
Chunky Monkey, Funyuns, I can feel the cat judging me
Please, I've seen you eat your puke and drink the toilet water
Which completely renders your opinion void, you little fucker
Poison puffers hit the reef, hissing through their missing teeth
Pissy like a Minotaur with six hours in the middle seat
Or middle schoolers protesting the mystery meat and
Catcher
ban
Castaways walk into the same light as Carol Ann
Dagger in his teeth and treat a rapper like a rack of lamb
His allergy is middling, his middle finger's Plastic Man
Dag,
they want a de-radicalized youth
Though it sort of undermines the magic of high noon
My right hand writing a diary of the dodgy
I do the wrong thing when all the right people are watching
It's a medley of defiance and outfoxing
Born in a storm's eye alongside Long Island swamp kings
Bonk,
shoegaze rap, get your blue suede
Get used to the goofy get-a-clue face
Jump into the goon goose chase, try the Kool-Aid
Try the blue plate, it tastes like doomsday
Off-leash gryphons at the Westminster Kennel Club
As vessels of Beelzebub bite the hand that belly-rub
Lug it to the belfry, keep the pups alive and healthy
We, as hunters, treat the summers like a mother ripe for milking
Up and feeding Alexander Pardee art into the silk-screen
Still here, sleeping with the lights on and quill near
Tour van, corpse paint, war moon
Make the bass wobble like a two-man horse suit
Dork-proof, type to forge a sword in his dorm room
Break fiends, drain threes from the warp tube
Long tooth, short fuse,
Stormtroopers over John Zorn loops
If you ain't core, it ain't for you
Trolls, bubbling from the lows
Want nothing but to run him for the bulk of what he owns
Homie, all of this material ain't shit to me, the trinketry
The filigree, the antiquated theories of validity
I never really cared for the cars
The Point A-to-B sounds scared when it starts
Trash can fire in the middle of the crib
Where the coven swap recipes and riddles from the crypt
It's monsoon season, keep the log flumes leanin'
Religious paranoia get the Doc Seuss treatment
Breaking out the Bronx Zoo, tabletop the Mongoose
Grey fade; ain't afraid to knock a few cogs loose
I'm from where it's "Defense!" on three
And anybody with a fucking brain bump Sean P
Old boy, might combine the carve with the stalefish
All aboard the mid-life snail's pace tailspin
You were busy authoring the holy grail of mailed-in
I was busy snow, sleet, heavy rain, hail, wind
Ready, aim, fail shit, it's Hail Marys everywhere
Over all the petty shit, under all the messy hair
I'm (
Untouchable, uncrushable
) plus ill
We don't need another hero, we just want our cups filled
I'm Trivial Pursuit cards at the 40/40; buzzkill
Aesop Rock, code name: "Yo, son, chill"[Intro: Percee P &
Aesop Rock
]
Geeeeeeeeeeeeeeet up!
(Wake up, wake up!)
Ayo Percee P, it's time to wake these kids up
Word up Aesop Rock, they'd better take their fingers off pause and hit record

Is you fat cats or lab rats?
Trails to my steppin got em sweatin flashbacks
I played a part of minesweeper, plunking sneakers in my sunken city
Defunct, and apparently examinin' famine
I'm a volatile strobe while your blind spot swallows the globe
Sink through the track and think back
When I was a boy I employed styles exhausted
By every lost child at present, normally I drill pillars of normalcy
You're cordially invited to accompany me
In rotations of the tables to label the opposition
As I choose
,
refusing to evolve with the cold
Rapidly dissolved my involvement in a solvent of soul and roll back
Brain trip the Beta weights trap for the slaughter
Like livestock infected with anthrax
On my call a pack or clan snaps, collapsed was the mandatory maze
Where the bluest ribbons yeilded glory days
Desire on the opposite circuit and glorious days
Is glorious hazes of gray spun through my array of operation
Slave to idiot box revelations
And wrapped tightly in a practice with my colleagues and slackers
20,000 league nappers
and the swelling increases
Once the mortar hit the pestal your whole vessel fell to pieces
And I laughed, I laughed for me and my starving art family
I laughed tangibly, your failures ampin me to vamp fresh
My mic stabs white flags in drags, trembling
Devil skin-wearers through the terrors of compliance
Once the
day turns night
, senoritas suck the woody like termites
And wonder how they got labeled dick-hungry damsels in distress
The all new and improved poetically portable Aesop Rock
Available in stores with my
Highly suggested parental discretion
In 99 brilliant new dimensions

I'm not your average man bragging, toe or hand tagging
50 grand bagging, pants sagging, trigger nigga on the bandwagon
Huh
,
I know this nigga named Rickey his girl Nikki want to get with me
Says "Stick me just a quickie, lick me and leave a hickie"
I stick instead of tricking bread in this chickenheads
One got slick and said I ain't shit in bed, she must be licking lead
You'd better let your gods recognize the Rhyme Inspector hides
And never sweat them lies about me haters check your eyes
One verse, lung burst, as I done first
Guns, slums, hearse don't stun Perce, where I'm from's worse (sucker)
My new cuts are hot, bodies chewed up a lot
Then flew up the block to a cipher, blew up the spot
Stacks of rhymes, ain't a match for mines, tracks and shine
Leave you back in time in a ?beeler? still ain't at my prime
I'm a stab your face in, trial and shit is wild
I turn the dial, niggas stealing my style
I should file for reparations
"Aesop Rock" "Percee P" *scratched til fade*
It would've been the most beautiful second-coming of Christ
That anyone had ever seen

The water ain't safe, the land's made of water
I hug a half-empty glass
my dignity's tryin' to pawn her
I'm tryin' to see the future in a tea cup and a saucer
But I rather be drinkin' coffee with my cigarette foster
Can a run-away buckle the cloud-nine fantasy filter to force the brutal truth of daily marketplace wars through the roof?
I mean, I stood beneath the icicles that bleed under the awning
And magically mastered the great absorbing of spirit falling
But I'm sick, I've plowed these fields a thousand times over
Sold botanical research studies to farmers with whole quarters
And when science proposes to art besides that peaceful sea
I'll be that cat with a ring on a pillow, shouting: "Finally!"
Take a number, the apple seeds raineth upon your slumber
A hundred thousand freaks on parade for the village hunter
My every whim acted upon has gone loopy
But I play a game called
"Let's prepare barnacle city for the end-all noosings."
I split the radius of go-getter bellies, reconnaissance
Sleeping fossil genie bottle optimist freeze
Run for the fountain but the fountain is a desert optical tease
Tummy full of sand, running man, impossible, stop
There's a wing in my gut and I'm all dust
Surfin' the urban Iditarod, certainly flushed
Now one in the hand is worth two atop the tallest cedar
But what lies inside my heart is off the motherfuckin' meter

The water ain't safe no more
I'm just tryin' to build myself to act as a truly better man, damn
See, the water ain't safe no more
I'm just tryin' to be a solid oak tree
For every child to carve its name across
The water ain't safe no more
I'm just tryin' to be the dream
Of every peasant the hurricane can offer
See, the water ain't safe no more
I'm just tryin' to be somebody
I can talk to in the morning with a smile
The water ain't safe no more

And I've always been a 40-night chronologic hostage
Rusted hook in the lip of the monarch
Wingless anime idol
I don't play in the man race cycle,
hope floater
Gloating inside carnal indifference
'Til doom cops a slot and potent quotas
I'm 20 something, pumping acrylic tomorrow sideways
B
lazing passage with a map tattooed on the back of the classless
Now tip-toe across a lost cause
Because a lost cause found don't mean you found a cause
That means you found a lost cause
Okay, now I've been here for role-playing
Slaying my here and now
To benefit consumption for my peers steering the plow
And it's incredible
Handy jackets turn numerals to sentinels
But bad apples ain't sweet
And cretins' saddles ain't that memorable
I'm Mozart with a focus on the tide
Hiding the inconsistencies of man behind water and wine
I wear a tiger-striped ego and bivouac my progression
Where the kindlings formulated
Through the flesh of the oppressors
Now, God had a flask, I can prove it
You really think the thirteen loops that used honor
Spawned me a sober unit?
Check potion, addressed the ghost inside my TV with a ruler
Adhered to the back bone, stone pusher
Here ten thousand hackers deep in the movement
That's 20,000 crucial ruby heels clicking in unison
And it's beautiful, I keep a stick inside my hand
And carve my name inside every wall of the falling hologram
Vita est morte est vita
Life is death is life

Found nothing but the feathers and the skull
On the porch like a present with a bow
Denizen of black earth, gutted and uncoupled from the patchwork
Buried by a 7 year cherub in the backyard
Epitaph and all
Disciple of the cycles and sciences, of birth into fertilized hyacinth
Life into vitamins, invited up to cypresses
A testament to moxie and the miracle of lifelessness
It's tricky when you'd rather rot into the soil as a nutrient
Than navigate this mortal coil in human skin, dig?
The nuances of putrefying jelly hit the levee
When those feathers are a cancer in your bestie
And I pick a ginger gold as fed by a drunken uncle
One from a customer pumping that Sumner blood work
Memitim ascending, settling any high scores
40 meters up with the heart of a high dive horse

Paint "No Rules" on the water tower
Paint "No Rules" on the water tower
Paint "No Rules" on the water tower
Paint "No Rules" on the water tower
(Impossible, impossible)

Hold the fuck up
Who is you talking to?
Cause ain't nobody talking to you
You can't do a motherfucking thing

I told my ex in '97 I was falling on my weapon
Ripped the phone up out the wall
The po' would drag me from my bedroom
An embarrassing ordeal involving hospitals and questions
And the kind of doctors who use words like "cognitive" and "spectrum"
While explaining why you're selfish to romanticize a ruse
In which unruly roots pull you to Lucifer by your shoes
I mean, it isn't perfect but don't misconstrue the purpose
Any urge is indiscernible from community service to the kiddo
Plus she'd make a beautiful widow
But that's an altruistic ticket to a room with no windows
Hmm you'd think he would've learned back in the 80s
When they pulled him out of class over concerns about his safety
But he didn't, it wasn't cause he doesn't get the message
More he doesn't judge a man by how honorable his death is
On a scale you made up anyway
Half past out to pasture
Whether clapped or batteries in backwards
Che-che-che-check it
This is for all those super scientifical, uh, "Geniuses" turned "Underground Thug", who think Hip Hop is Dead but can't get their fucking style out of '94
Point to us like we're not hip hop
(Point to us like we're not hip hop x3)


I brought that genuine shit in '96
Before you knew the underground or independent existed
I watched the whole scene straight jump on the dick
After stepping to KCR lit and flexing my shit
No gun talk, no gimmicks, just rounds of raw-dogging
Dirty dusty intelligent wit and word murdering
A hardcore poetic informed without burglary
Potent and shook the shit out of rappers who just learned of me
Everytime I prescribe a new pill--revolution
Quickly defined the standard for indie rap distribution
Arrogant unafraid shit developed riding a train thinking of brain fucks
"Bad Touch Example" that soon became bucks
Had everybody sprung wondering where I came from
Screaming out "Independent as fuck" with an insane tongue
With an indelible squad of design monsters
Innovating the styles that made biters look like imposters
So we scripted an album and signed to Rawkus
Selling a hundred thousand without a radio chart hit
Preposterous sonics taking the world hostage
Classic hip-hop bombage dirty with style progress
Now I've come from the '80s juvenile Brooklyn
Where cats was like: "Gimme that subway pass, kid. Good lookin."
Now someone else is taking a ride with what's mine
So I had to develop styles with a death device cooked in
So when I battled in basements I had eight sentences
Waiting way before the four you had laced in
And I was taught to be patient (Why?)
Only faggots switch they shit up just to get famous
So when I finally blew up I remained sick
Earning respect in ghettos and 'burbs for word placement
Back when the independent scene remained faceless
We were the only crew who promised your ass we'd take it
Mold it, shape it, living outside the matrix
Hold it, make it, more than miniature major labels
Hold it sacred, living it for the culture
Told ya plainly, protected it from the vultures
That's why I always get respect from true soldiers
While half of the critics claim it every year: "Hip hop's over."
FUCK YOU, hip hop just started
It's funny how the most nostalgic cats are the ones who were never part of it
But true veterans'll give dap to those who started it
Then humbly move the fuck on and come with that new retarded shit
New slang, new thought, new sound
Who's heart you thought you had?
You clown, you don't, you drown
I won't dumb it down
, I'm dumbing now for these rounds
I'm a live mothefucker plus I'm gunning for clowns
You're a mime motherfucker, don't be coming for pounds
So you can break out of that invisible box, you're not down
My favorite ones are the ones who started that young rap about
Comic books, spaceships, and Obi-Quan one
And even though they were soft they had fun
But they couldn't break out the frame of the town they came from
Some of these faggots used to send me their demos
I'm keeping their puppy styles in the Company Flow kennels
But since they had no identity from the start
They started to resent the scene when they couldn't become a part
They've been failing for years and call themselves Vets, that's bold
Motherfucker, you're not a Vet you're just old
I'll slap the shit out of you to continue my nerd rap
Making this money fist over fist, fuck what you heard
Jukie cats talk about boom bap and golden ages
Patting themselves on the back for making that new outdated shit
I've been putting out vinyl since '93 and never looked back once
And ya'll trying to chase me
You don't innovate because you can't innovate
It's not a choice despite what you might tell your boys
Keep your identity crisis under the table
I always knew who I was and I'll always be more famous

Leave the last "C.E." off for Craps and buy them Haterade
Dig it, daddy dug his own tunnel under the gutters where the numbers bleed
Hunters froze up and exposed Rapunzel weeds
Tugboat, tug up through that brutal dirt first
The fuedals fuming oodles, it was right under your poodle skirt
Welcome to Bazooka Works, halogen halo eyesore
The revolution will not be apologized for
Warbucks exlex megaphone on the fashion piggy pageant
While my dick's raw-dogging a style magnet
Fraggle rock your four figure watch
I clock ninety-nine cent wristbands
And still know the time when you record flops
Now this is on a sick with it factor
Exhibit A. E. S., Genesis of the klepto reactor
Wanna burgle the buzz over definitive cash
After a life of labor camps starts paying innovaters back
Baby, you ain't felt the collective? (Coooool)
Stop running bases with little bears under the wing of punchdrunk Buttermakers
That engine sputters while the hound dogs wire cutter mechnical rabbit
Bantam weight puppies ain't rabid enough to snatch him
Pockmark ninety Moses approach with a golden focal point
Come soak in it, résumé sturdy composer soldier bliss
Wrong name by a molar can often expose your phobias
Watch a cobra grow hands to hold his own tongue when he notices
All city legity critter, bark with me
All filthy documents, cats piss on their kittie litter moccasins
Welcome to mi casa, Monsters Inc, dropping bangers out the rocket ships
Your own private apocalypse
Parachute ratty, one bunk cord now the air is scooped badly
Dripping out the sticks like a twig-tweed hammock
Miter cut the cables for that quick, clean transit
Miser took the big screen; Panic made a business card
Ankle out of whack, painkiller tobacco scrap
We navigate the yellow corn hype for the barn
When the spotlight swiveled hard right over the farm
Post up, 3 cheers for the gimp
Spread thank you (3 on the right)
Limp to the door, splint what he mangles (3 on the left)
Yea I knew the percentages
But the numbers were unaware of the grand finale's emphasis
And over the scent of a thousand dead dogs
Agent Zip
Zooka swore to pull it off, GAMEFACE
Walkie-talkies squawking up his hip regarding paratroopers: 20 (Ha!)
Tug a noise box trigger reporting for hunting

I have landed safely
I have not recieved my papers
I have zero natural enemies
I don't know my location
I have no training in reconnaissance, combat or colluding
I'm calling for my orders, over
(STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!)

Clonopin to kill a horse, numb and bloodthirsty
'Till the 'uncle' spitter beg a jungle pig to hug mercy (Ha!)
Two 40-below shit
, kickers tickle the corpses (duck!)
Duck the widow-maker, also manufactures orphans (ok...)
Manufactures ornaments,
if it moves stick a fork in it
Winners take all, killers rape all coordinates
Unfortunately, courted by the most tenacious gaurdian
Whose aimless nature bait a harlequin taste the martyr's skin
No Semper Fi
(Nope),
no saluter unit
Soldier the fire is more flesh than sulfur
And when the automatic-jitters wiggle the ribs
I feel so alive it don't matter which bitches litter is clipped (Bang!)
Sun down, goggle up
canteen gobble-juice
Teargas nozzle up. Brain buff, hostile youth
Chop it up, lock a noose upon it
You will die for the glory of...Shit, I can't put my finger on it
But it's big! Big and legitimate
Justify women and kiddie killer shit, iller it builds
So he is not a natural predator, but can dismantle an AK-47
Clean and rebuild before you can mayday bretheren
(Mayday!)
Muddy-gut snake eyes
,
he approaches cobras with an ugly muck
And bloody Bowie knife clamped in the canines
Wake 'em with that blind military mechanism set to bludgeon
WHAT IS YOUR MAJOR MALFUNCTION!?
(Now hear this)
It's big Aesop Rock
(Now hear this)

Metropolitan, grab bag apocalypse
Maggot patch is swallowing the traps baddest columnist
Big vision, tiger soul, anonymous alacrity, and pulse
Held together by a beached bucket of bolts
I'm here to bleach masker lust and touch false allegations
Where the born-agains and pagans claim the same corner store pavement (pavement)
Silence and the needle pin hybrid
Bought you this reflecting pool to school you on my underlying bias
Now if
I polish off the poison with a sip
I know my orphanage massive will help you lift my casket
With the drip of this B-positive and ominous last cackle
Bury me beneath the cherry tree bough and run for the castle
(I'm one propaganda)
I'm one propaganda speech ahead of televised
Recognize-life-cycler, too deep to stop and decipher
We cross-section a vision every genus dreams
Something obscene with
Syncopated, simultaneous land speed achievement
(drench)
Drench! River-dance your way through bed and breakfast
Blemished predetermined destiny checklist (but first check this)
Well I was born upon a swiftly tilting galleon
Circling sloppy pseudo stigmatic pity-me sound system servers (oh god)
We the dicky-dawn left handed scribbles of god
Approached gruesome by drunk buddy system twosomes
One attacked sternum turned to vaporized minor (c'mon)
The second in turn circled to confirm the fertilizer
And I'm one of a small tribe camped in a rubber stamp facility
With best friends like utility who needs these instabilities of mine
You wanna hold that grudge that's fine
In fact let's both hold grudges just to see who's stubborn and who budges
Well I'm the stubbornest bastard this side of four dimensions
And I'm here to build this picket fence around your frigid lenses
I ain't ever known a potion as potent as zen to mend a broken friendship
I'm saying don't get defensive
(Now hear this)

Wise up, rise up, size 'em up
Line 'em up against the wall

Spin doc
Sweet dreams go Hitchcock
Discord with no sick days
Limbs draped in all ripstop
Faded ink on my ribcage
My glass heart, my shit brains
My jaguars around beautiful New York strip steak
Ain't shit change
Doodle over these blueprints
I been shoo-shooed, I been boo hissed
Chewed up, he's too much
I ain't too much, y'all too prim
World's end around curfew
When they rotate grotesque forms
Sneak up in some mech suit
Make off with they best horse
Roads paved with pulled pins
Hood sprayed with wolf piss
Engineer of this tire fire
Come pull up on that bullshit
I might peace out of my deep freeze
And turn pale death in like two shakes
Swoop in and get touchéd
Tune in to my blue phase
October, I'm in bloom
When that cold snap and that wind croon
Trail mix in my road pack
And no roads back to this igloo
Stick and move around dead light, he ain't talk much
Step aside for my left-right, I'm like on one
Never mind when these dogs mush

Days seem normal, but the nights get pretty weird
Trip the wrong light, y'all might get disappeared
I'm in here
I'm in here
Days seem normal but the nights get pretty weird
Trip the wrong light, y'all might get disappeared
I'm in here
I'm in here

Fall back
Black dawn above fawn tracks
These mallrats get dragged off to this golf clap
Bath salts in my black coffee
I'm back-talk from that wrong path
Y'all rag dolls, tagalongs
Become thumb tacks on wall maps
Dreadnought with no false flag
I'm all red cape and my real name
Around senseis from that steel cage
With like ten ways to steal paint
Field notes and my whetstone
And my steel toes and my pet crow
Red phone on sleep mode
When eating eel rolls with my friend's ghost
Okay, wide load with no peers
White smoke from both ears
Rain gods that wave wands around biomes y'all hold dear
I go so off, it ain't no thing
I make no comment
No job beyond cold-blooded coyote king
Hone in on my smoke rings
Most often, I kick rocks
Where that room tone is all pin drop
Peek into my ethos
It go please hold, I will not
Creep show, he throw Sno-Caps from these nosebleeds
Comfortable around cold facts and unknown seas
Cro-Mag, I don't sleep
Somebody in a cultivated moment of distress
Composed themselves enough to artfully carve "Zoso" in his desk
They was probably thinking "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!" in they head
With a hell bound arm in a acidy wash
Homemade curfew a thousand o'clock
And the pot leaf tattoo his friend did drunk
Like a badge of mystique though it technically sucked
Taking the name of the father in vain
On the way to the blade in his locker
Estranged
A switch he lifted from a sibling's skivvy drawer
Who'd branched off into ninja stars
And never knew his shit was sharked to
Here with a higher purpose
And a primal urge of juvenile berserkers
Like Crocea Mors in a arcade drop claw
Gouging a valentine for Miss Othmar
Watch
Capital Zed, slowly maneuver the O
S is the most difficult to control
Finally O
Into the eye of Goliath you go
That levy crushin' percussion'll pull the monkey upright
Twelve or ghetto blaster
Black or technicolor telecaster
Lecture at a faster rate than class was making them develop backwards
It would appear you spelled out all the answers

When they ask how you, feeling you, tell em you, feeling like
Something important died screaming, you, tell em you, feeling like
Something even more important arrived breathing, something you should probably try feeding
When they ask how you, living you, tell em you, living like
Something important died hissing, you, tell em you, living like
Something even more important arrived giving
Something you should probably try willing
(alright, same here)

Somebody in a cultivated moment of distrust
Composed themselves enough to magic-marker "Zulu" on these chucks
They was tryin to do the buckle font from 'Renegades of Funk'
In a 3d frame of exploding brick
And whiz-lines for the locally motion sick
Beyond gross but evoked a host of "oh dip"
Where a social neurosis owned the whole strip
Heart of a cat with a lark in his mouth
In the marrow of waiting his guardians out
Flashlight
Chisel tips
Milked venom
Pistol grip
Images relocated from milled vellum to scissor kick
Silent agreement at hand
King of the hill for a queen of the damned
She in the doorway seething began
"That clean white pair had a 3-year plan"
Oops
Capital "ZED" Radical "U" in the cut
Truly to beautiful "L"oser it up "U" and he done
Collateral damage a future alum that key to Shambala
Planet rocking Bambaata
Sample chop
Churning out a cancer for the vandal squad
Analog
And he finds
Animated colors on a page
Like synthesized cultures on a stage

Look
Unsigned hype, front line aeronauts flurry
Zero dark thirty
Zero Friends minotaur-fugly stepchild
Evoke lunch jumped over plunging necklines
Up, beside tongue-tied hungry enzymes
Devolved into mothmen munching textiles
Punisher, out past go-time
Back 10 fried worms chubbier
Brown grass both sides
Canned food
,
manmade tools
Lanacane, band aids, mandrake root
Bindle on a broomstick, pancaked shoes
And a handshake-proof campaign, can't lose
Can't gain
Smoke out moles like a force of nature
Pray fortune return to his favor, swiftly
Maybe in the form of a nest egg
Maybe in the form of a Tesla death ray
Or a solid gold scene with something better to celebrate
Than powder on a face like a flatfoot on jelly day
M-m-moral compass all batshit
Spinning in the shadows of immoral magnets
Are we supporting the artist or enabling the addict?
I mean, I guess it matters to me, I wish it mattered to you
How a thousand virtues
Kick the same bucket like chinatown turtles

Roving packs of elusive young become
Choke-lore writers over boosted drums
In the terrifying face of a future tongue
(Down) Down from a huntable surplus to one
Down from a huntable surplus to one
(Down) Down from the huntable surplus to one
Down from a huntable surplus to one
(Down) Down from the huntable surplus to one

Check his own breakneck pulse over colors in a drain
That emote sugar skulls in the rain
Flower-eyes melting
Guided by a levee made of bath tiles,
tilting
Quarter up and headed for the kill screen
No corner cut, no build team
Only a particularly menacing
Angle perpendicular to everything
Boys room cherry bomb
Boy/goon very much runnin' with the devil in the mellotron
Hello!
Here's where a tale of caution
Pounds coffin nails to bootlegs of Hawkwind
Saw tooth, nevermind straw to gold
Spin hearts on sleeves into heads on poles
Arm in the maw
Fish out pith like a business card from a jar at the mall
A-alike androids dreaming of carbon applause
Get stuffed with cartoon cigars
Cold pack, neti-pot, home to roost
Around folk backed into what they most lampoon
Shook to the fevered brow and broke ankles
Daisy, declawed pound, no thank you
Fade me, failed all basic training
But I spent a couple groundhog days with a changeling
Silhouette,  the god's last cigarette
Anything less would be ri-god-damn-diculousThey did not know how long they had been there
They did not know how long they had been there
They did not know how long they had been there
They did not know how long they had been there

The more the merrier
Get a couple or more to carry you to the burial
F-R-E-S-H
Fresh to death and keep it
def to the left
Well it was Capricorn, Virgo, Aquarius
(Check!), Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius
(Check!), Pisces, Libra, Scorpio, Aries, Gemini, Taurus
Let 'em die for it

Delicate freak show alert the frame
Bash all flags where the
mag spin park
Corroded by the volts that jolt the cold vein
Boogie down kits to slip past the guard
Def with a mascot of radical mass
Megaphone fuzz and a woofer on fritz
We are not trained to divert the crash
But march face first with a prayer for the blitz
Stand up for the cinema fire, simian ire
Cold shimmy for the cinnamon sky;
Intimate eyes loop all known alleys
Scoop the bounty like daddy hires Bazooka to murder Ralphie
I curdle with burnt milk, pariah sigh,
honor piranha money
Count it with the knuckle that hustle bread out a copper-tummy
One of these rebels could level the marked city
But the N.Y. uber alles governor's picky
I'll be the jenky Jesus for the species you bleed with
Ultra, soldier poach the folklore
Jump guns through the ninth gate
Jump guns like a noon six burner lit up on the ninth pace
Even set among a portion conformed to the blind stage
Never lured by the formal watching imported wines age
We bow to the gusto mustered by the mecha-bot
Plowed by the public, ushered out the letterbox
Wowed by the subject punctured by the helicop
Boy meets vermin: the widescreen version
Headaches, nausea, vomiting, facial paralysis
These are a few of my favorite venomous side effects
Mamba, Water Moc, Pit Viper, Diamond Back
Anaconda, Boomslang, Cobra, bite 'em back
Spinal tap crabs to the clapper
Aesop Rock is the Cadillac of natural disaster
Push that button
Everybody gotta push something
That's why the envelope is where it wasn't
I work with the builders, whittle my gorilla military
And fizzle 'em through the vigilante filters
Who lamps left of the toggle?
How'd they fit that ninja in a bottle?
Done a hundred million motherfuckers with they hands out
Versus a walking zipper bomb trying to keep the man down
Get up (get down)
Sit up (sit down)
It's either fancy footwork (or get bit by the hounds)
Face up (face down)
Laced up (laced down)
It's either fist to the sky (or get bit by the crowd)
Well it was Capricorn, Virgo, Aquarius
(Check!), Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius
(Check!), Pisces, Libra, Scorpio, Aries, Gemini, Taurus
Let 'em die for it

I was chewing my tongue out of my mouth one day
When the blood in my beard hit the dirt by the blazers
Would have said 'curb it' like any nervous habit
'til maverick told me the coyote pack could smell the wound for acres
And labor to cater fang to fisherman gut critters
Oblivious to the glimmer of innocent duck feathers
Fuck it
Want a carnivore war? Bet
I'll be at the Bronx Zoo with a lock pick kit
On the eject for cockpit bench, helicop clip
Nazi cops on kamikaze belly flop shit
Roger, hop-fence-kill-a-crop, monster
We are the tired and poor, we come for your water
Boom!
Bounce when the church corrupt
When the mayor knuckle dust city worker bugs
When the stars finger babies like I flirt with sluts
You'll see the fire engine red fox ears perk up
Metal kettle unsettling treble howl, settler trembling
Measuring mellow on the levitate off the mezzanine
Never seen a ton of bricks dressing clean dapper
'til it's pin stripe and skull chunk forty stories after
And U.S.A. on a Ketamine disaster
Cane for stress
Crack if the former left you unimpressed
Now pardon me if part of me heart of an oddball, but damn
Kumba-fucking-ya, dog
Terminally alienated and bent awkward by the bought
Prepped package of the slickest spin-doctors
Raised where the paranoid hide tools proper
Like suspicious cargo in a high school locker
And it looks like war, quacks like war
So it's Occam's Razor and I'm swayze out the door
A hundred million motherfuckers hold me back
The hand cannons won't ask 'bout your zodiac, boy
